## eff.recipe

This is a recipe that can be put into calibre to download EFF blog posts onto an eink device.  

## Testing

To test, open up eff.recipe, and comment out the production variables at the top in favor of using the variables marked testing.  
Then cd a terminal window into test/ and serve that directory over port 80.
This will speed up downloading quite a bit.  
Then run ./make.sh from the repo's main directory to begin a test.
