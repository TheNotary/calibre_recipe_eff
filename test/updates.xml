    <title>“Notice-and-Stay-Down” Is Really “Filter-Everything”</title>
    <link>http://127.0.0.1/a1</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Proposed Law Is Unfair to Both Users and Media Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a debate happening right now over copyright bots, programs that social media websites use to scan users’ uploads for potential copyright infringement. A few powerful lobbyists want copyright law to require platforms that host third-party content to employ copyright bots, and require them to be stricter about what they take down. Big content companies call this nebulous proposal “notice-and-stay-down,” but it would really keep &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; users down, not just alleged infringers. In the process, it could give major content platforms like YouTube and Facebook an unfair advantage over competitors and startups (as if they needed any more advantages). “Notice-and-stay-down” is really “filter-everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the debate sit the “safe harbor” provisions of U.S. copyright law (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512&quot;&gt;17 U.S.C. § 512&lt;/a&gt;), which were enacted in 2000 as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca&quot;&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;. Those provisions protect Internet services from monetary liability based on the allegedly infringing activities of their users or other third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 512 lays out various requirements for service providers to be eligible for safe harbor status—most significantly, that they comply with a notice-and-takedown procedure: if you have a reasonable belief that I’ve infringed on your copyright, you (or someone acting on your behalf) can contact the platform and ask to have my content removed. The platform removes my content and notifies me that it’s removed it. I have the opportunity to file a counter-notice, indicating that you were incorrect in your assessment: for example, that I didn’t actually use your content, or that I used it in a way that didn’t infringe your copyright. If you don’t take action against me in a federal court within 14 days, my content is restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DMCA didn’t do much to temper content companies’ accusations that Internet platforms enable infringement. In 2007, Google was facing a lot of pressure over its recent acquisition YouTube. YouTube complied with all of the requirements for safe harbor status, including adhering to the notice-and-takedown procedure, but Hollywood wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google was eager to court those same companies as YouTube adopters, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/congrats-10-year-anniversary-youtube-now-please-fix-content-id&quot;&gt;it unveiled Content ID&lt;/a&gt;. Content ID lets rightsholders submit large databases of video and audio fingerprints. YouTube’s bot scans every new upload for potential matches to those fingerprints. The rightsholder can choose whether to block, monetize, or monitor matching videos. Since the system can automatically remove or monetize a video with no human interaction, it often removes videos that make lawful fair uses of audio and video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/12/31/2015-32973/section-512-study-notice-and-request-for-public-comment&quot;&gt;some lobbyists think that content filtering should become a legal obligation&lt;/a&gt;: content companies are proposing that once a takedown notice goes uncontested, the platform should have to filter and block &lt;i&gt;any future uploads of the same allegedly infringing content&lt;/i&gt;. In essence, content companies want the law to require platforms to develop their own Content-ID-like systems in order to enjoy safe harbor status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, the notice-and-takedown procedure has its problems. It results in alleged copyright infringement being treated differently from any other type of allegedly unlawful speech: rather than wait for a judge to determine whether a piece of content is in violation of copyright, the system gives the copyright holder the benefit of the doubt. You don’t need to look far to find examples of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/takedowns&quot;&gt;copyright holders abusing the system&lt;/a&gt;, silencing speech with dubious copyright claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, safe harbors are essential to the way the Internet works. If the law didn’t provide a way for web platforms to achieve safe harbor status, services like YouTube, Facebook, and Wikipedia could never have been created in the first place: the potential liability for copyright infringement would be too high. Section 512 provides a route to safe harbor status that most companies that use user-generated content can reasonably comply with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A filter-everything approach would change that. The safe harbor provisions let Internet companies focus their efforts on creating great services rather than spend their time snooping their users’ uploads. Filter-everything would effectively shift the burden of policing copyright infringement &lt;i&gt;to the platforms themselves&lt;/i&gt;, undermining the purpose of the safe harbor in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That approach would dramatically shrink the playing field for new companies in the user-generated content space. Remember that the criticisms of YouTube as a haven for infringement existed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/30/business/30tube.html&quot;&gt;well before Google acquired it&lt;/a&gt;. The financial motivators for developing a copyright bot were certainly in place pre-Google too. Still, it took the programming power of the world’s largest technology company to create Content ID. What about the next YouTube, the next Facebook, or the next SoundCloud? Under filter-everything, there might not be a &lt;i&gt;next&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s something else to consider about copyright bots: they’re not very good. Content ID routinely flags videos as infringement that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/why-facebook-inspecting-your-private-videos&quot;&gt;don’t copy from another work at all&lt;/a&gt;. Bots also don’t understand the complexities of fair use. In September, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/takedown-senders-must-consider-fair-use-ninth-circuit-rules&quot;&gt;a federal appeals court confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that copyright holders must consider fair use before sending a takedown notice. Under the filter-everything approach, legitimate uses of works wouldn’t get the reasonable consideration they deserve. Even if content-recognizing technology were airtight, computers would still not be able to consider a work’s fair use status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/why-facebook-inspecting-your-private-videos&quot;&gt;certain powerful content owners seek to brush aside the importance of fair use&lt;/a&gt;, characterizing it as a loophole in copyright law or an old-fashioned relic. But without fair use, copyright isn’t compatible with the First Amendment. Do you trust a computer to make the final determination on your right to free speech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/copyrightweek&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2016/01/19/social-copyrightweek.png&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;We&#039;re taking part in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/copyrightweek&quot;&gt;Copyright Week&lt;/a&gt;, a series of actions and discussions supporting key principles that should guide copyright policy. Every day this week, various groups are taking on different elements of the law, and addressing what&#039;s at stake, and what we need to do to make sure that copyright promotes creativity and innovation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fair Use Economics: How Fair Use Makes Innovation Possible and Profitable</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/fair-use-economics-how-fair-use-makes-innovation-possible-and-profitable</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over 30 years ago, the Supreme Court issued its landmark ruling in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5876335373788447272&amp;amp;scilh=0&quot;&gt;Sony v. Universal City Studios&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;(usually referred to as the &lt;i&gt;Sony/Betamax&lt;/i&gt; case), clearing the way for a technology company to sells its products (Betamaxes, and by extension, VCRs) even though they could potentially be used for infringing purposes. After all, the court reasoned, customers also deployed their VCRs to engage in non-infringing fair uses, such as recording soap operas to watch after work. If a product was capable of “substantial noninfringing uses,” the fact that it could &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; be used for unlawful purposes shouldn’t be enough to force it off the market (and/or require its maker to pay millions in damages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That decision is emblematic of the role fair use plays in providing breathing space in copyright law, making sure that control of the right to copy and distribute doesn’t become control of the right to create and innovate. New technologies and services often create multiple “copies” as a matter of course during their operation. At the same time, copyright terms cover works many decades old and copyrighted software appears in more and more devices. Taken together, these developments mean the potential reach of copyright may extend ever further. Fair use makes sure that the rights of the public expand at the same time, so add-on creativity and innovation can continue to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take last year’s ruling in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/big-win-fair-use-google-books-lawsuit&quot;&gt;Google Books&lt;/a&gt; case. For years, Google cooperated with libraries to digitize books and create a massive, publicly available and searchable books database. It has become an extraordinarily valuable tool for librarians, scholars, and amateur researchers of all kinds. It also generates revenue for authors by helping them reach new audiences. Nonetheless, for almost a decade the Authors Guild has argued that its members are owed compensation in exchange for their books being copied, digitized, and included in the database. The Second Circuit disagreed, finding that Google was making a fair use of the works because the reason Google had to make the copies was in order to allow others to engage in fair use. Along the way, it rejected the notion that fair use doesn’t protect “technological” fair uses like digitization (as opposed to “creative” repurposing, such as a remix video).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google Books decision is fair use doing its job: making sure that copyright law serves, rather than impedes, the public interest. Thanks to copyright rules governing the right to copy, distribute, and perform, the folks who held copyrights in the works at issue in the above cases has (and have) a chance to seek compensation. And thanks to copyright rules protecting fair uses, other creative people, their users and the public had (and have) an opportunity to engage with those works in new and unexpected ways. Of course innovators have to take a chance that a court will find their uses to be fair—but absent fair use the copyright risk would make that innovation impossible. That’s fair use as &lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1273385&quot;&gt;innovation policy&lt;/a&gt; and according to one study it’s helped generate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.project-disco.org/intellectual-property/012115-fairly-useful-the-many-ways-fair-use-helps-industry/%5Dhttp://www.project-disco.org/intellectual-property/012115-fairly-useful-the-many-ways-fair-use-helps-industry/&quot;&gt;trillions for the U.S. economy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every decision like that in the Google Books case, however, we still see fair use tested. For example, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/dangerous-decision-fair-use-tveyes-case&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News v. TVEyes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; case, a great decision on the fair use of radio and TV excerpts was followed up by a troubling one that walks back some of the protections for new and innovative uses of media. Two years ago, Fox News sued a company called TVEyes, which creates a text-searchable database of broadcast content from thousands of television and radio stations in the United States and worldwide. It’s used by journalists, scholars, and political campaigns to study and monitor the national media. In September 2014 the court ruled that the service was for the most part engaging in fair uses, but wanted to know more about certain features. In August 2015, it issued a perplexing ruling that TV Eyes was liable for infringement because some aspects of the service &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; be used for infringing purposes—even though it admitted those features could also be used for non-infringing purposes. That ruling can’t be squared with &lt;i&gt;Sony/Betamax&lt;/i&gt;, and misses the mark on how fair use is flexible enough to include uses never before seen; we look forward to seeing it overturned on appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/copyrightweek&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2016/01/19/social-copyrightweek.png&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;We&#039;re taking part in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/copyrightweek&quot;&gt;Copyright Week&lt;/a&gt;, a series of actions and discussions supporting key principles that should guide copyright policy.

    <title>The FCC Should Ensure Digital Rights for Prisoners and Their Families</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/fcc-should-ensure-digital-rights-prisoners-and-their-families</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the lens of someone with little direct experience with prisons and jails, corrections systems in the United States may look like they&#039;re improving how prisoners communicate with the outside world through new technologies, such as inmate email, video visitation, and media tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from the perspective of inmates and their friends and family, these new technologies often do not result in stronger lines of communication at all. Some prison officials use the technology to justify restricting in-person visitation or traditional mail. Many communications services are offered under unfair terms and with artificially inflated fees that are only possible because the services operate monopolies at each prison or jail. In addition, users of these systems face potential privacy violations, as illustrated by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2015/11/11/securus-hack-prison-phone-company-exposes-thousands-of-calls-lawyers-and-clients/&quot;&gt;recent Securus data breach&lt;/a&gt; of more than 70-million prisoner phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/eff-comments-fcc-prison-communication-services&quot;&gt;EFF filed comments&lt;/a&gt; this week with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is considering new regulations for telecommunications technology in corrections facilities, also known as inmate communication services (ICS). We urge the commission to use its power to ensure that consumers—inmates, their friends, relatives, and legal representatives—benefit from telecommunications services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF made five recommendations to the FCC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The use of video calling and other communications services in prisons and jails should increase, not reduce, contact between prisoners and their families.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF strongly believes that technology can expand opportunities for everyone to communicate, organize, and express themselves. This too should be the case for inmates and their families. As we write in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to prisons and jails, however, video and other electronic communications services are all too often being to used to restrict, and in some cases, replace, in-person visits. As the Prison Policy Initiative’s report [&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.prisonpolicy.org/visitation/ScreeningOutFamilyTime_January2015.pdf&quot;&gt;.pdf&lt;/a&gt;] on video calling in prisons and jails describes, these services are often supplanting face-to-face visits by either replacing visiting hours entirely or requiring prison visitors to use on-site video chat terminals.  Providers of video calling services, jails, and prisons are thus using new technology to create new and substantial barriers between prisoners and their families, flipping the promise of new communications technology on its head. Moreover, PPI’s report on current video calling systems in prisons and jails demonstrates that current video calling services suffer from poor video quality and delay, further demonstrating that the services are not an actual substitute for in-person conversations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The FCC must protect the privacy of inmate communications service customers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our comments, EFF agreed with Public Knowledge that the FCC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/securus-leak-of-prison-call-records-underscores-importance-of-fcc-oversight&quot;&gt;must investigate&lt;/a&gt; the leak of more than 70 million phone calls by Securus, one of the largest providers of inmate communication services in the country.  But the FCC shouldn’t stop there. As we write in our comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFF recognizes that prisons, jails, and ICS companies might often have an interest in monitoring and storing the communications of detainees and prisoners for legitimate security purposes. Prisons, jails, and ICS companies, however, have no legitimate need nor the legal authority to store all prisoner communications permanently, and are not categorically exempt from the Fourth Amendment’s guarantee against unreasonable searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we ask the FCC to limit the collection and storage of call records and contents to only what is demonstrably necessary to meet a correction institutions’ security needs. This should include limits on what a provider may collect as well as a requirement that data be purged when it is no longer needed. The FCC should also bar communications providers from profiting from the collection and storage of customer data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A prisoner’s use of certain online services should not, by itself, result in punishment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year and a half, EFF has documented how many inmates (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/hundreds-south-carolina-inmates-sent-solitary-confinement-over-facebook&quot;&gt;most notably in South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;) have received extreme sentences for maintaining profiles on social media. Sometimes inmates manage these profiles using contraband phones, but often inmates rely on their friends and family to manage their profiles on their behalves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we write in our comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mere use of online services should not, by itself, be a crime or result in punishment of prisoners. Services such as Facebook enable greater communications between prisoners, their families, and friends, a goal the Commission has explicitly endorsed in this rulemaking. Violations of a website’s terms of service or other agreement should not automatically be elevated into punishment within a facility. Rather, violations of a contract, such as Facebook’s rule against third parties using another’s profile, should ordinarily be dealt with between the service and its users.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inmate communication service providers should not abuse their position and subject their customers to onerous contractual terms. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year an inmate in Indiana recorded a short video using the prison’s official videogram system and sent it to his sister. After she posted it to Facebook, the prison punished the inmate and cut the sister off from further communication. The prison administrators claimed that they had violated the provider JPay’s intellectual property rights. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/hidden-cost-jpays-prison-email-system&quot;&gt;As EFF discovered&lt;/a&gt;, JPay’s agreement included unfair terms that all communications passing through JPay’s system belonged to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we write in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If found to be enforceable, this would give the company ownership, for example, of any poems that prisoners wrote for their families and transmitted over a company channel. Although JPay later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/jpay-will-no-longer-claim-ownership-over-inmate-family-correspondence&quot;&gt;removed this provision&lt;/a&gt; from its Terms of Service, it is yet another example of the inherently imbalanced power dynamic between ICS customers and providers, most of which are prisoners’ sole means of communicating with family by phone or online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Charges for video calling and other advanced communication services should be cost-based.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a general consumer is deciding between Internet  service providers, they are likely to choose the company offering the best bang for buck. In a prison context, however, the consumers shelling out the cash (often inmates’ families) have no option but to use the system chosen by the prison or jail. Unfortunately, jails and prisons have often based their contracting decision not on the benefit to the user, but rather perks and profit sharing offered by the companies bidding on the contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we write in our comments, developments in communication technology should result in lower costs, not higher ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as it costs almost nothing for a nonprisoner to make a phone call, the cost of using a video calling service such as Apple FaceTime or sending an email are similarly minimal. ICS providers use the same underlying technology and infrastructure that the general public relies on to make video calls or send emails.  Thus, the actual costs of the communications is likely to be low, subject to the initial costs involved in installing video calling terminals and other devices within a facility and ongoing costs of running a network. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Digital Freedom Depends on the Right to Tinker </title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/why-owning-your-stuff-means-owning-your-digital-freedom</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;One of the most crucial issues in the fight for digital freedom is the question of who will control the hardware that you have in your home, in your pocket, or in your own body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Have you ever been frustrated when a beloved feature was taken away in an update? Or felt helpless to prevent the apps on your phone from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/problem-mobile-phones&quot;&gt;oversharing your personal data&lt;/a&gt; with advertisers? Or had to pay through the nose for proprietary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/lexmark-v-static-control-case-archive&quot;&gt;cartridges of ink&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://michaelweinberg.org/post/137045828005/free-the-cube&quot;&gt;3D printing material&lt;/a&gt;? Or found that your independent repair shop wasn’t allowed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/automakers-say-you-dont-really-own-your-car&quot;&gt;fix your car&lt;/a&gt; or appliance? If so, then you&#039;ve experienced a small—but accumulating—frustration of losing of control over your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;People entrust their health, safety, and privacy to such devices every day, as with medical implants, vehicles, or devices with microphones you keep in your pocket or cameras in smart TVs aimed at your living room. There are good reasons to outsource decisions about your devices&#039; software to knowledgeable, trustworthy sources, but you should always have the ultimate say in who deserves your trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Manufacturers take that choice away when they build in technical measures that restrict device-owners&#039; access to the software controlling the device. Typically the tinkering community is quick to come up with a means of access for popular devices, and in pre-digital times, you were perfectly within your rights to tear open your appliances and vehicles to see how they worked and tinker with them. This was even true in the early days of electronics, since traditional copyright law allows for reverse engineering, research, and other forms of tinkering. Two legal regimes threaten those freedoms, though: Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and restrictive Terms of Use to which you theoretically agree when you buy a device containing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Section 1201 was enacted to combat copyright infringement of digital works by making it unlawful to circumvent access controls on those works (such as the encryption on a DVD). Because of the broad definition of a copyrighted work, however, Section 1201 potentially implicates the software in your car, pacemaker, phone, television, or other digital device. Federal appeals courts are split on whether fair use even applies to protect acts of circumvention that are necessary to make fair uses of the underlying work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, copies of software are often being &quot;sold&quot; subject to restrictive licensing terms that purport to transform the &quot;sale&quot; into something less: a mere license to use the software in specific ways authorized by the vendor. Go beyond the permitted uses enumerated in a non-negotiated &quot;End User License Agreement,&quot; and not only do vendors sue for breach of contract, they argue that you become a copyright infringer. When courts credit this argument—which they occasionally have done—vendors are able to rewrite the aspects of copyright law they find inconvenient, such as fair use rights to create derivative works or to learn from the software via reverse engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Both Section 1201 and non-negotiable form licenses have something in common: they threaten to replace the &quot;grand bargain&quot; of copyright law with a one-sided system of restrictions lacking the necessary protections for free speech, competition, innovation, or the autonomy of device owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The law is still evolving with respect to Section 1201 and the enforceability of abusive license &quot;agreements,&quot; both in the courts and in Congress. Senators Grassley and Leahy have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/senators-probe-copyrights-impact-software-enabled-devices&quot;&gt;tasked the Copyright Office&lt;/a&gt; with collecting public input on how copyright law should interacting with &quot;software-enabled consumer products.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The Copyright Office inquiry is broken up into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://copyright.gov/fedreg/2015/80fr81369.pdf&quot;&gt;Section-1201-specific inquiry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://copyright.gov/fedreg/2015/80fr77668.pdf&quot;&gt;another inquiry&lt;/a&gt; covering issues such as one-sided contracts, the resale of digital copies of copyrighted works, fair use, and the question of when software should be considered copyrightable in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We look forward to weighing in on these issues and explaining to the Copyright Office and to Congress that copyright can only serve its goals of promoting speech and innovation if it includes robust protections for all of us to make use of and build upon the software and other creative works that permeate our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We&#039;ll Probably Never Free Mickey, But That&#039;s Beside the Point</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/well-probably-never-free-mickey-thats-beside-point</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2016/01/13/animation_3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Steamboat Willie, Copyright Disney 1928&quot; title=&quot;Steamboat Willie, Copyright Disney 1928&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a mere 24 months, Mickey Mouse will enter the public domain—right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mickey Mouse is synonymous with copyright term extension, and with good reason. Every time the first Mickey cartoons creep towards the public domain, Disney&#039;s powerful lobbyists spring into action, lobbying Congress for a retrospective term-extension on copyright, which means that works that have already been created are awarded longer copyright terms. In the USA, copyright law is supposed to serve an incentive to make new works, and there&#039;s no sensible way that getting a longer copyright on something you&#039;ve already made can provide an incentive to do anything except lobby for more copyright, and sue people who want to make something new out of your creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in 1976 and 1998, the US Congress gave Disney—and everyone else, including the overwhelming majority of absentee proprietors who didn&#039;t know or care about any of this—decades of extra copyright on works that already existed. This state of affairs has been lamented at enormous length by people smarter than me, so let&#039;s just say that economists, cultural theorists, and copyright scholars are virtually unanimous in viewing retrospective copyright term extension as both absurd and tragic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the copyright on those early Mickey cartoons will end (if Congress doesn&#039;t repeat the sins of &#039;76 and &#039;98, that is—and you can bet we&#039;ll be pulling out all the stops to prevent that). What happens then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost nothing, if Disney and friends get their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;align-right&quot; src=&quot;/files/2016/01/13/056c026d-1c66-4d42-9fae-a8e96df290c5-1020x915.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;title card for Steamboat Willie&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt; Those Mickey cartoons are almost certainly in the public domain anyway. In the late 1920s, copyright wasn&#039;t automatic: rightsholders had to undertake certain &quot;formalities&quot;—registering with the Copyright Office and displaying correctly formatted notices—and then renew those formalities periodically. Scholars who&#039;ve looked into the matter make a very good case that the early Disney organization flubbed its registration, notice and renewal, and there are probably cartoons that are in the public domain today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is not to say that Disney wouldn&#039;t sue you if you tried to remix them, upload them to the Internet Archive, or sell them in on a compilation DVD of other public domain cartoons from the period. They almost certainly would, and it would cost you an unthinkable sum of money to defend yourself. Emerging victorious but impoverished, you would have won a small victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at that point, we expect that Disney will try to use another body of law to suppress creativity and commerce involving Mickey Mouse, whether or not &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; and &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; are in the public domain: trademark law. If you sell something Mickeyish—including its public domain cartoons—Disney might ask a court to stop you because people who buy the&lt;br /&gt;
cartoons from you may think they&#039;re buying from Disney. Back to court with you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney would be wrong, according to current law. The Supreme Court ruled in 2003’s &lt;a title=&quot;Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.&quot; href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13445605668854417212&amp;amp;q=dastar&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=2006&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox Film&lt;/i&gt; Corp.&lt;/a&gt; that you can’t use trademark law to extend an expired copyright. But we suspect that with the copyrights on many iconic films and characters poised to expire, Disney and friends will try to get &lt;i&gt;Dastar&lt;/i&gt; overruled or at least undermined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a new Mickey Mouse thing, you might be better off arguing fair use than public domain, anyway. Fair use covers transformational use for commentary, parody, education and many other uses. If you&#039;re trying to make new Mickey stuff with the &quot;public domain&quot; Mickey from the 1928 cartoons, you&#039;ll have to be careful not to encroach upon the visual elements of Mickey that Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks and the other artists who worked on the shorts developed over time in other cartoons that are still under copyright. Fair use has no such constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is Disney fighting so hard to keep these—minor, probably public domain—cartoons still in copyright(ish)? Because of what happens &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; enters the public domain. Have a gander at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Disney_theatrical_animated_features&quot;&gt;Disney filmography&lt;/a&gt;. If &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; unambiguously enters the public domain in 2018, then in 2027, &lt;em&gt;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&lt;/em&gt; joins it there. Things putter along for another decade (&lt;em&gt;Pinocchio&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fantasia&lt;/em&gt;, 2030; &lt;em&gt;Dumbo&lt;/em&gt;, 2031; &lt;em&gt;Bambi&lt;/em&gt;, 2032; &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&lt;/em&gt;, 2039) but in 2040, we get to &lt;em&gt;Cinderella&lt;/em&gt; and after that, it&#039;s pretty much a major feature film &lt;em&gt;every year&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt; in 2041, then &lt;em&gt;Peter Pan&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lady and the Tramp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sleeping Beauty&lt;/em&gt;... Every year, a new major movie that anyone can sell, remix, or build a ride around—assuming they can navigate the trademark issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ambiguity of overlapping trademarks and copyrights, combined with the very long duration of copyrights, and confused legal history about whether characters themselves get copyright when parts of their canon enter the public domain is a source of great mischief for many of the characters of the last century. Sherlock Holmes is &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2014/biz/news/sherlock-holmes-case-decision-public-domain-1201346225/&quot;&gt;in the public domain&lt;/a&gt; (so long as you steer clear of details introduced in some of the films, and elements of the character developed in the handful of stories published after 1923), but litigious organizations threaten people who &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2009/02/25/conan-copyright-trol.html&quot;&gt;treat Robert E Howard&#039;s Conan as if he were in the public domain&lt;/a&gt;, and the same goes for &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2015/10/16/buck-rogers-and-the-copyright.html&quot;&gt;Buck Rogers&lt;/a&gt; and the HP Lovecraft canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Free Mickey&quot; is a great slogan to shorthand what&#039;s going on with term extension, but the reality is a lot messier. Disney&#039;s lobbying for term extension isn&#039;t a stiff-necked insistence that everything that Saint Walt laid his hand upon must be forever his company&#039;s stewardship: it&#039;s a long-term bid to retain control over assets they make a lot of money off of. The side effects of their self-interested pursuits are arguably a lot worse than what we lose by keeping a handful of unregarded cartoon shorts in copyright: the overwhelming mountains of orphan works for which no owner can be found, meaning all copies of them will likely disappear before their copyright lapses; and the welcoming territory for naked copyright trolling by those who would simply extract rents from the creations of the long dead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Copyright Week 2016: Making Copyright Work For The Public</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/copyright-week-2016-making-copyright-work-public</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2016/01/19/social-copyrightweek.png&quot; alt=&quot;Copyright Week&quot; height=&quot;325&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We&#039;re taking part in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/copyrightweek&quot;&gt;Copyright Week&lt;/a&gt;, a series of actions and discussions supporting key principles that should guide copyright policy. Every day this week, various groups are taking on different elements of the law, and addressing what&#039;s at stake, and what we need to do to make sure that copyright promotes creativity and innovation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s hard to believe we&#039;re almost three years into the U.S. copyright reform process kicked off with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/2013-copyright-review-process&quot;&gt;call to Congress for the Next Great Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;—and that we&#039;re kicking off the third annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/copyrightweek&quot;&gt;Copyright Week&lt;/a&gt; to boot. Once again, we&#039;re working alongside great partners in the copyright space to make sure that the public—from technology users, to readers, to fans, to artists—get their voice heard in debates that are all too often limited to a few industry lobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re entering a critical stage, too. It&#039;s been four years this week since Internet users staged the largest ever online protest of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/coica-internet-censorship-and-copyright-bill&quot;&gt;a bad copyright law, the Stop Online Piracy Act&lt;/a&gt;, that would&#039;ve curtailed online speech and created a system of blacklists for sites and users. Four years ago, millions of us spoke up and derailed that proposal. But a lot can change in four years, and indeed we&#039;ve started to see Hollywood and others try to sneak elements of SOPA back into the debate, through private agreements with intermediaries, influence on state officials, extraordinary injunctions in court, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond site blocking, &lt;a href=&quot;http://eff.org/cases/2015-dmca-rulemaking&quot;&gt;this summer&#039;s DMCA rulemaking&lt;/a&gt; revealed another way in which an imbalanced copyright law hurts the public: allowing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/drm&quot;&gt;DRM software&lt;/a&gt; to encroach on our right to use our own physical stuff. Much of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/whos-driving-thing-anti-drm-victories-and-milestones-2015-review&quot;&gt;conversation has focused on cars&lt;/a&gt;—a technology that traditionally encouraged tinkering and repair, now increasingly locked down—and the writing is on the wall: unless we fix the law around DRM, it will be used to take away our rights in more and more of the things we own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation is incomplete, though, when we just talk about the harms created by overly restrictive copyright. We need, also, to pay attention to the benefits of a cultural commons—a shared collection of material that we all may freely share and build upon. That&#039;s why today, the first day of Copyright Week, we&#039;re focusing on the public domain, and how the law can foster a stronger one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that spirit, we&#039;re once again putting forward a set of principles for what copyright law and policy should look like. Please, read them, share them, support them, and tell your lawmakers about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building and Defending a Robust Public Domain.&lt;/b&gt; The public domain is our cultural commons and a public trust. Copyright policy should seek to promote, and not diminish, this crucial resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;You Bought It, You Own It.&lt;/b&gt; Copyright policy should foster the freedom to truly own your stuff: to tinker with it, repair it, reuse it, recycle it, read or watch or launch it on any device, lend it, and then give it away (or re-sell it) when you&#039;re done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fair Use Rights.&lt;/b&gt; For copyright to achieve its purpose of encouraging creativity and innovation, it must preserve and promote ample breathing space for unexpected and innovative uses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency.&lt;/b&gt; Copyright policy must be set through a participatory, democratic, and transparent process. It should not be decided through back room deals or international agreements negotiated in secret.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, there&#039;s a lot to say about these four simple principles. So we&#039;ll be linking to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/copyrightweek&quot;&gt;blog posts and actions throughout the week on the landing page&lt;/a&gt;. Follow along, and participate: if you write or create something to support these principles, share it on social media and tag it #CopyrightWeek so we can see it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EFF Pries More Information on Zero Days from the Government’s Grasp</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/eff-pries-more-transparency-zero-days-governments-grasp</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until just last week, the U.S. government kept up the charade that its use of a stockpile of security vulnerabilities for hacking was a closely held secret.&lt;a class=&quot;see-footnote&quot; id=&quot;footnoteref1_010xboo&quot; title=&quot;For what it&#039;s worth, the government denies having a “Raiders of the Lost Ark style” stockpile of zero days.&quot; href=&quot;#footnote1_010xboo&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; In fact, in response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/eff-v-nsa-odni-vulnerabilities-foia&quot;&gt;EFF’s FOIA suit&lt;/a&gt; to get access to the official U.S. policy on zero days, the government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/its-no-secret-government-uses-zero-days-offense&quot;&gt;redacted every single reference to “offensive” use of vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;. To add insult to injury, the government’s claim was that even admitting to offensive use would cause damage to national security. Now, in the face of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/vep-foia-effs-xmsj-and-opp&quot;&gt;EFF’s brief marshaling overwhelming evidence&lt;/a&gt; to the contrary, the charade is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to EFF’s motion for summary judgment, the government has disclosed a new version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/vulnerabilities-equities-process-january-2016&quot;&gt;Vulnerabilities Equities Process, minus many of the worst redactions&lt;/a&gt;. First and foremost, it now admits that the “discovery of vulnerabilities in commercial information technology may present competing ‘equities’ for the [government’s] offensive and defensive mission.” That might seem painfully obvious—a flaw or backdoor in a Juniper router is dangerous for anyone running a network, whether that network is in the U.S. or Iran. But the government’s failure to adequately weigh these “competing equities” was so severe that in 2013 a group of experts appointed by President Obama recommended that the policy favor disclosure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2013-12-12_rg_final_report.pdf&quot;&gt;“in almost all instances for widely used code.”&lt;/a&gt; [.pdf].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly disclosed version of the Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP) also officially confirms what everyone already knew: the use of zero days isn’t confined to the spies. Rather, the policy states that the “law enforcement community may want to use information pertaining to a vulnerability for similar offensive or defensive purposes but for the ultimate end of law enforcement.” Similarly it explains that “counterintelligence equities can be defensive, offensive, and/or law enforcement-related” and may “also have prosecutorial responsibilities.” Given that the government is &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-fbis-unprecedented-hacking-campaign-targeted-over-a-thousand-computers&quot;&gt;currently prosecuting users for committing crimes over Tor hidden services&lt;/a&gt;, and that it identified these individuals using vulnerabilities called a “Network Investigative Technique”, this too doesn’t exactly come as a shocker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks ago, the government swore that even acknowledging the mere fact that it uses vulnerabilities offensively “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/declaration-jennifer-l-hudson&quot;&gt;could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security&lt;/a&gt;.” That’s a standard move in FOIA cases involving classified information, even though the government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/new-report-finds-obamas-policies-threaten-independent-press&quot;&gt;unnecessarily classifies documents at an astounding rate&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, the government relented only after nearly a year and a half of litigation by EFF. The government would be well advised to stop relying on such weak secrecy claims—it only risks undermining its own credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version of the VEP also reveals significantly more information about the general process the government follows when a vulnerability is identified. In a nutshell, an agency that discovers a zero day is responsible for invoking the VEP, which then provides for centralized coordination and weighing of equities among all affected agencies. Along with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/vep-foia-richberg-declaration&quot;&gt;declaration&lt;/a&gt; from an official at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, this new information provides more background on the reasons why the government decided to develop an overarching zero day policy in the first place: it “recognized that not all organizations see the entire picture of vulnerabilities, and each organization may have its own equities and concerns regarding the prioritization of patches and fixes, as well as its own distinct mission obligations.” We now know the VEP was finalized in February 2010, but the government apparently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2014/11/michael-daniel-no-zero-day-stockpile/&quot;&gt;failed to implement&lt;/a&gt; it in any substantial way, prompting the presidential review group’s recommendation to prioritize disclosure over offensive hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re glad to have forced a little more transparency on this important issue, but the government is still foolishly holding on to a few last redactions, including refusing to name which agencies participate in the VEP. That’s just not supportable, and we’ll be in court next month to argue that the names of these agencies must be disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;footnote1_010xboo&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnote-label&quot; href=&quot;#footnoteref1_010xboo&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/a&gt; For what it&#039;s worth, the government denies having a “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2014/11/michael-daniel-no-zero-day-stockpile/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Raiders of the Lost Ark&lt;/i&gt; style&lt;/a&gt;” stockpile of zero days.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Ike Had a Dream, and it Unfortunately Came True</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/ike-had-dream-and-it-unfortunately-came-true</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today marks the 55th anniversary of a world-historical speech by the last victorious military commander to occupy the White House: President Dwight D. “Ike” Eisenhower. His last speech while in office holds crucial implications for the U.S. today, as well as the history we celebrate tomorrow, on Martin Luther King Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ike served in World War II as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe before becoming President. He helped encourage an industrial mobilization that enabled the U.S. to liberate Europe and defend democracy from the global threat of fascism, but he expressed concerns about its future consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/indust.html&quot;&gt;his departing address&lt;/a&gt; to the American people before leaving the White House, President Eisenhower described the necessity of creating a defense industry intertwined with secret government agencies, while predicting—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y06NSBBRtY&quot;&gt;in no uncertain terms&lt;/a&gt;—that they would together come to present a threat to democracy in America. Ike said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[W]e can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government….Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. &lt;i&gt;The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;We should take nothing for granted.&lt;/i&gt; Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together. (emphasis added)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the benefit of 55 years of hindsight, Ike appears more prescient than Nostradamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few issues better embody the threat to democracy posed by the military-industrial complex than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/dragnet-nsa-spying-survives-2015-review&quot;&gt;mass NSA surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, which continues despite widespread criticism and protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to challenge unconstitutional domestic spying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying&quot;&gt;in the courts&lt;/a&gt;. But years after we filed our first challenge, however, we are still seeking crucial rulings. Some legal decisions have vindicated widespread concerns about the emergence of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/12/19/almost-orwellian-why-judge-leon-is-right-about-massive-nsa-spying-program.html&quot;&gt;almost Orwellian&lt;/a&gt;” systems of domestic spying, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/supreme-court-dismisses-challenge-fisa-warrantless-wiretapping-law-effs-lawsuit&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; have unfortunately allowed those programs to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass surveillance has also forced attention from the executive branch. President Obama promised surveillance reform when running for the White House, writing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/state-union-ignoring-elephant-room&quot;&gt;campaign pledge&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 to support “any steps needed to preserve civil liberties and to prevent executive branch abuse in the future.” Once in office, he commissioned a review group to issue recommendations, but the administration then declined to adopt most of those recommendations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/state-union-ignoring-elephant-room&quot;&gt;falling short&lt;/a&gt; of the president’s campaign promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Congress last year imposed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/new-usa-freedom-act-step-right-direction-more-must-be-done&quot;&gt;first restrictions in two generations&lt;/a&gt; on U.S. intelligence agencies, but just months later embraced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/eff-disappointed-cisa-passes-senate&quot;&gt;new surveillance measures&lt;/a&gt;. And it enacted both sets of laws before ever conducting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/note-congress-nsa-seizes-more-just-your-conversations-israeli-leaders&quot;&gt;an independent investigation&lt;/a&gt; to uncover crucial facts such as how many Americans have been monitored by the NSA, or how many times the system has been abused by people using the government’s powerful tools for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/24/loveint-when-nsa-officers-use-their-spying-power-on-love-interests&quot;&gt;disturbing personal purposes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point is important, because on the few occasions that it has examined the intelligence agencies, Congress has discovered recurring violations of constitutional rights. Shining a light on such violations has led to essential limits on the agencies’ powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the most significant congressional investigation was in the 1970s, when ad hoc committees convened in the Senate under Senator Frank Church (D-ID) and the House under Rep. Otis Pike (D-NY) revealed what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michaelslevinson.com/churchbook3.html&quot;&gt;the U.S. Senate in 1976 described as&lt;/a&gt; &quot;a sophisticated vigilante operation aimed squarely at preventing the legitimate exercise the First Amendment rights of speech and association….&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Congress had uncovered was known within U.S. intelligence agencies as the Counter-Intelligence Programs, or COINTELPRO. It was a well-kept secret until a group of antiwar activists in Philadelphia literally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/steven_rea/20150306_Film_Review_--__1971___doc_on_burglary_at_FBI_office_in_Media__Pa_.html&quot;&gt;broke into an FBI office&lt;/a&gt; to take and copy files that had long remained secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most prolific target of unconstitutional surveillance during this era was a figure whose memory we celebrate with a national holiday tomorrow, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His example, involving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/fbis-suicide-letter-dr-martin-luther-king-jr-and-dangers-unchecked-surveillance&quot;&gt;not only surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, but also a character assassination campaign and a coordinated attempt to drive him to suicide, should serve as a stark reminder to anyone today who thinks that because they have nothing to hide, they have nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Dr. King is not alone: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democracynow.org/2012/3/27/judi_bari_revisited_new_film_exposes&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/19/animal-rights-activists-challenge-federal-terrorism-charges&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kris-hermes/the-nato-5-terrorism-charges_b_2552554.html&quot;&gt;abound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Snowden revelations should have sparked the same outrage that drove the Church and Pike committees to investigate and reveal &lt;a href=&quot;https://vault.fbi.gov/cointel-pro&quot;&gt;COINTELPRO&lt;/a&gt;. They still could, if Congress finally does its job and investigates the issues that Snowden and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2013/06/nsa-whistleblower-klein/&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/23/the-secret-sharer&quot;&gt;whistleblowers&lt;/a&gt; have raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, a decade and a half since the beginning of the mass surveillance regime, a robust congressional investigation still has yet to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a great deal to learn from President Eisenhower&#039;s prescient warning. His final speech as President appears increasingly poignant, particularly as we celebrate the memory of an international hero who was targeted by parts of the military-industrial complex that Ike helped create and grew to fear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senator Franken Concerned Over Google’s Treatment of Student Privacy</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/senator-franken-concerned-over-googles-treatment-student-privacy</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After we filed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/ftc-complaint-google-education&quot;&gt;our complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about Google&#039;s unauthorized collection of personal information from school children using Chromebooks and the company&#039;s educational apps, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/student-privacy/schoolsurvey&quot;&gt;we heard from hundreds of parents&lt;/a&gt; around the country concerned about K-12 student privacy. This week, an important voice in Washington joined their growing chorus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Senator Al Franken (D-MN) wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.franken.senate.gov/files/letter/160114.GoogleStudentData.pdf&quot;&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; to Google CEO Sundar Pichai asking for information about the privacy practices of Google Apps for Education (GAFE). Several of his questions reflect concern over the issues we raised with the FTC. Sen. Franken is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Explaining his reasons for writing to Google, Senator Franken wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]s schools increasingly rely on technology in the classroom, students and their families have raised legitimate concerns about the privacy and security of students&#039; data. There have been an increasing number of stories of the misuse of student data or poor security practices in schools using EdTech tools. When used appropriately, technology is a valuable tool for teachers and students alike, but we must ensure that students&#039; very sensitive data are protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter then zeroes in on the core issues at stake in our FTC complaint–how Google tracks and treats student data when children are logged into their GAFE accounts but navigate outside the GAFE suite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]here may be a discrepancy in how Google treats student data obtained through its core Google Apps for Education (GAFE) services—products that are deemed educational—versus how Google treats student data obtained through other services that are not deemed educational, such as Google Search, Google Maps, or YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we pointed out in our FTC complaint, as a signer of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentprivacypledge.org/?page_id=45&quot;&gt;Student Privacy Pledge&lt;/a&gt;, Google publicly promised it will refrain from collecting, using, or sharing students&#039; personal information except when needed for legitimate education purposes or if parents provide permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet without parental consent the company tracks and records students’ online activity in certain Google services and feeds it into an ad profile attached to the students’ educational accounts. Is there an educational purpose in that practice? Senator Franken has asked Google to explain why it collects this information, and as we raise in our FTC complaint, whether &quot;Google [has] ever used this kind of data for its own business purposes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter also inquires about the viability of an &quot;opt-in&quot; regime in which students and their families would participate only after granting their affirmative consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re glad that Sen. Franken is examining these issues and look forward to seeing Google&#039;s response. Greater transparency by EdTech providers could greatly benefit student online privacy, as well as security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:10px&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Share this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Senator%20Franken%20Concerned%20Over%20Google%E2%80%99s%20Treatment%20of%20Student%20Privacy&amp;amp;url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/senator-franken-concerned-over-googles-treatment-student-privacy&amp;amp;related=eff&amp;amp;via=eff&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/twitter48.png&quot; alt=&quot;Share on Twitter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/share.php?t=Senator%20Franken%20Concerned%20Over%20Google%E2%80%99s%20Treatment%20of%20Student%20Privacy&amp;amp;u=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/senator-franken-concerned-over-googles-treatment-student-privacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/facebook48.png&quot; alt=&quot;Share on Facebook&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/senator-franken-concerned-over-googles-treatment-student-privacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/gplus48.png&quot; alt=&quot;Share on Google+&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sharetodiaspora.github.com/?title=Senator%20Franken%20Concerned%20Over%20Google%E2%80%99s%20Treatment%20of%20Student%20Privacy&amp;amp;url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/senator-franken-concerned-over-googles-treatment-student-privacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/diaspora48.png&quot; alt=&quot;Share on Diaspora&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://supporters.eff.org/join&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#cc0000; color:#ffffff; text-decoration:none; cursor:pointer; padding:5px 8px; font-family:verdana; font-weight:bold; border-radius:8px; text-shadow: 1px 1px #660000; text-transform:uppercase;&quot;&gt;Join EFF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Here&#039;s How the Senate Should Fix the FOIA Reform Bill </title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/heres-how-senate-should-fix-foia-reform-bill</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the U.S. House of Representatives passing a bill &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/01/house-passes-foia-reform-again-217606&quot;&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt; to amend the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), EFF and a coalition of other groups &lt;a href=&quot;//www.openthegovernment.org/node/5097&quot;&gt;are calling on members of the Senate&lt;/a&gt;  [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/foia-reform-coalition-letter-senate-january-2016&quot;&gt;.pdf&lt;/a&gt;] to pass a law that meaningfully improves government transparency and accountability through access to federal records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is becoming something of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/congress-must-pass-foia-reform-legislation&quot;&gt;annual tradition&lt;/a&gt; for Congress to introduce FOIA legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support. This year’s bill is the FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nsarchive.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/h653_sus_xml-2.pdf&quot;&gt;H.R. 653&lt;/a&gt;), and it contains many of the same amendments to FOIA found in recent bills, including narrowing some of the most-abused exemptions in the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though members of both the House and Senate have strongly supported past FOIA bills, Congress has failed to pass a law after agencies subject to the bills’ heightened transparency requirements pushed back. For example, in 2014 the U.S. Department of Justice was &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom.press/blog/2014/12/obamas-justice-department-secretly-killed-foia-transparency-bill-was-based-its-own&quot;&gt;instrumental&lt;/a&gt; in killing FOIA reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite what is likely to be another fight against DOJ and other federal agencies, EFF remains optimistic that Congress will pass comprehensive FOIA legislation this year. As the bill waits to be heard in the Senate, below is a summary of the good and bad aspects of the legislation along with some proposals EFF would like lawmakers to consider adding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant provision of the bill prevents agencies from withholding records unless they can identify a “foreseeable harm” to one of the interests protected by FOIA’s nine exemptions. This provision would cut back on agency discretion to withhold records that may technically fall within an exemption. Further, it is buttressed by other sections of the bill that require agencies to proactively disclose more records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, like its predecessors, also narrows what agencies can withhold under Exemption 5, which exempts internal or inter-agency “pre-decisional” memos and other documents that reflect the agency’s “deliberative process” in reaching a final decision. Despite Congress crafting Exemption 5’s deliberative process privilege to encourage robust internal agency debate, it has become one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2014/03/27/the-next-foia-fight-the-b5-withold-it-because-you-want-to-exemption/&quot;&gt;most overused and abused&lt;/a&gt; FOIA exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill passed this week would prevent agencies from using the exemption to withhold documents that are more than 25 years old while also prohibiting its use on final agency opinions that have the force of law or any final guidance that would impact the public&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other improvements in the bill include making it easier for courts to award attorneys fees to requesters who sue for access to records and requiring that all federal agencies accept requests via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details about the bill, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2016/01/14/overall-good-foia-reform-bill-passes-house-with-troubling-ic-carve-outs-frinformsum-1142016/&quot;&gt;the National Security Archive’s summary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Bad &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the bill purports to increase government transparency, members of the House significantly undermined that promise with last-minute amendments for intelligence agencies that will almost certainly result in greater secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most troubling &lt;a href=&quot;http://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2016/01/house-foia/&quot;&gt;provision&lt;/a&gt; of the bill is a section that would prohibit disclosure of records that “would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods.” FOIA already contains an exemption for properly classified material, and there are a number of other federal laws that prevent disclosure of intelligence sources and methods, so what would the new language cover? The carve-out does not define what “adversely affect” means, so intelligence agencies would have a great deal of discretion to expand the types of records they can keep secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other bad provisions of the law exempt intelligence and surveillance agencies from two important procedural fixes to FOIA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, under the new bill agencies are required to inform requesters when they consult with another agency in response to a particular request. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-oip-guidance-referral-and-consultation-procedures&quot;&gt;Consultations&lt;/a&gt; are when one agency has responsive records that are largely based on records generated by another agency. Second, agencies would have to publish a list of all of the material they denied access to under FOIA unless the disclosure was prohibited by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current bill exempts all intelligence agencies from those fixes, which is a huge step in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given EFF’s longstanding fight against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/transparency&quot;&gt;government secrecy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying&quot;&gt;mass surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, the last-minute inclusion of these provisions and a lack of any public justification for why these agencies should be treated differently is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Should Be in the Bill&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of removing the bad provisions regarding the intelligence agencies, the Senate should amend the legislation to allow for greater public access to records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief among the changes EFF would like to see is the creation of a public interest balancing test for Exemption 5. This proposal, which has been in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2014/11/watered-down-foia-bill-advances-199049&quot;&gt;previous FOIA reform bills&lt;/a&gt;, would require information that may fall under Exemption 5 to still be disclosed if a requester can show that doing so is in the public interest. Thus, a court could override an agency claim of Exemption 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that provision was already in FOIA, EFF may have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/01/courts-decision-setback-not-final-word-fight-against-secret-law&quot;&gt;won a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; seeking legal memos on the use of National Security Letters to obtain citizens’ call logs without legal process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate should also add an amendment to clarify when agencies can withhold law enforcement techniques and procedures under FOIA Exemption 7(E). Federal courts have interpreted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/eff-files-brief-calling-greater-law-enforcement-transparency&quot;&gt;exemption differently&lt;/a&gt;, with some requiring agencies to show that disclosing the records would give potential lawbreakers a roadmap on how to evade law enforcement or otherwise break the law. Other courts have allowed agencies to withhold the records without having to make such a showing. EFF believes that agencies should have to at least justify withholding law enforcement techniques, particularly given that they are often controversial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF looks forward to working with other public interest groups and members of Congress to create meaningful reforms to FOIA that improve a law even lawmakers admit is &lt;a href=&quot;https://oversight.house.gov/report/freedom-of-information-act-is-broken-a-report/&quot;&gt;broken&lt;/a&gt;. The current bill is a step forward, though lawmakers must ensure that the current bill results in more than mere cosmetic changes to FOIA.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Send in Your FOIA Horror Stories for The Foilies 2016</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/send-your-foia-horror-stories-foilies-2016</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2016/01/15/sunshine-square-4.png&quot; width=&quot;335&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; /&gt;The Foilies are back! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, EFF launched our inaugural, tongue-in-cheek awards series for government agencies who thwarted, stymied, foot-dragged, and retaliated in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and other public records requests. We called out secrecy over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/foilies-round-2-law-enforcement-accountability/#stingray&quot;&gt;cell-site simulators&lt;/a&gt;, marveled at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/happy-sunshine-week-introducing-foilies/#chapo&quot;&gt;$1.4 million fee estimate for the DEA’s “El Chapo” file&lt;/a&gt;, and panned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/foilies-round-3-redactions/#meat&quot;&gt;Chicago Public Schools’ refusal to disclose what’s in its mystery meats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the government didn’t learn its lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, EFF will announce many, many Foilies winners during Sunshine Week, March 13-19, 2016. But before we can publicly shame those who foiled your access to government records, we need your nominations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who Can Win?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foilies are not given to people who filed FOIA requests. These are not awards anyone actually should want. In fact, there is no physical award. They are virtual distinctions of demerit issued to government agencies and public officials (plus the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/foilies-round-4-retaliation-and-consequences/#white&quot;&gt;odd rock star&lt;/a&gt;) who snubbed their nose at transparency. If you filed a FOIA request with the Ministry of Silly Walks for a list of grant recipients, and a civil servant in a bowler hat told you to take a ludicrous hike, then the ministry itself would be eligible for the Foilies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Are the Categories?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, we do not determine the categories in advance. Rather, we look at the nominations we receive, winnow them down to the most outrageous, then come up with fitting tributes, such as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/foilies-round-3-redactions/#irony&quot;&gt;Most Ironic Literary Redaction&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/foilies-round-4-retaliation-and-consequences/#passive&quot;&gt;Most Passive Aggressive Release of Records.&lt;/a&gt;” That said, there are a few things we’re looking for in particular, such as extremely long processing times and absurdly large fee estimates.  Most of all, we want your most surreal redactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who Can Nominate &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone, regardless of whether you were involved in the issue or just happened to read about it on Twitter. Send as many nominations as you like! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eligibility &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All nominations must have had some event happen during calendar year 2015. For example, you can nominate something related to a FOIA request filed in 1994 if you finally received a rejection in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deadline&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All nominations must be received by &lt;u&gt;Feb. 15, 2016&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Submit a Nomination&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send nominations to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:foilies@eff.org&quot;&gt;foilies@eff.org&lt;/a&gt; with “FOILIES 2015 NOMINATION” in the subject line. You can nominate multiple entries in a single email, just make sure to enumerate the nominations so we can easily separate them. Please try to include these six items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Category&lt;/i&gt;: One line suggested award title&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Description&lt;/i&gt;: Succinct explanation the public records issue and why it deserves recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Links&lt;/i&gt;: Include any links to stories, records, or other information that will help us better understand the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Attachments&lt;/i&gt;: If you have the original FOIA/public records request and subsequent correspondence to support the nomination, please include it with the email. We may seek this information out separately later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Attribution&lt;/i&gt;: Let us know if we can attribute the nomination to you and, if so, how you would like to be named (name, Twitter handle, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contact details: &lt;/i&gt;Include a way for us to reach you with further questions. This information will remain confidential.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Companies Should Resist Government Pressure and Stand Up for Free Speech</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/companies-should-resist-government-pressure-and-stand-free-speech</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;EFF has been steadfast in its criticism of officials like FBI Director James Comey, who have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/no-matter-what-fbi-says-compromising-encryption-technical-issue&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;implored tech companies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to provide a backdoor to their customers’ encrypted communications. Now it appears as though the White House would like a backdoor to the First Amendment’s free speech protections by requiring private tech companies to monitor, censor, and automatically report speech on topics related to ISIS and terrorism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;EFF’s concerns come after White House officials held a high-level meeting with technology companies &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/07/white-house-summit-silicon-valley-tech-summit-agenda-terrorism&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;last week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; asking for help in addressing terrorists’ use of social media. The administration also announced &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2016/01/white-house-says-new-task-force-will-fight-terrorism-online/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a task force&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to fight terrorism online. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the government directly censored the content of online speech about ISIS and other terrorist groups, it would be clearly unconstitutional. Private companies that host communications online, however, are normally not subject to the First Amendment and can set their own rules on the types of content and even viewpoints expressed on their services. Government officials know this and are now both subtly and not-so-subtly pressuring companies to achieve a result that the First Amendment prevents them from doing themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The government’s current tactics threaten the robust free speech on platforms that users have come to expect and could result in arbitrary and excessive removal of lots of legitimate speech. The tactics also suggest the government holds the bizarre view that tech companies are well-suited to identify and deter terrorist speech and threats online, a job that seems more appropriate for numerous federal national security and law enforcement agencies. EFF’s concerns are not idle speculation, as it appears that some companies are caving to the pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twitter’s Terrorist-related and Hateful Speech Policies will Restrict Legitimate Speech&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As EFF explained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/twitters-policy-reboot-good-bad-and-ugly&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;earlier this week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Twitter’s updated policies regarding prohibited speech include two problematic changes: (1) a new policy that prohibits individuals from “threatening or promoting terrorism” and (2) a new ban on any speech that threatens other people &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease” or incites harm toward others on the same bases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These vague policies grant Twitter a great deal of discretion to determine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;what constitutes a terrorist threat or hateful speech, meaning that the policies will likely be applied arbitrarily and potentially discriminate against certain communities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The company also provides no transparency about when and how often it blocks or removes tweets that run afoul of its new policies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The timing of the changes makes it appear as though Twitter is reacting to calls to prevent ISIS from using the platform to spread its message and recruit members. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;EFF hopes that Twitter will modify its policies and that the company’s changes are the exception rather than the rule. It remains to be seen whether other companies will follow suit in light of the U.S. government’s increased pressure to help fight ISIS and other terrorist networks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elected Officials are Exerting Pressure on Tech Companies to Censor Speech &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the White House’s recent meeting with leaders of some of the biggest tech companies reportedly took a relatively friendly tone, it was just the latest development in an ongoing effort by the government to force these companies to do exactly what it wants at the expense of their users’ free speech and privacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In December, Sen. Dianne Feinstein &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bna.com/terrorism-bill-puts-n57982065821/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;re-introduced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; legislation aimed at compelling social media companies to report their users. When Sen. Feinstein and her colleague Sen. Richard Burr first proposed the bill in July 2015, we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/mandatory-reporting-user-content-chills-speech-and-violates-privacy-rights&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pointed out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the bill had huge First and Fourth Amendment problems. Specifically, the bill’s language was vague as to what actually constituted “terrorism” that would trigger the mandatory reporting requirement, possibly resulting in companies reporting protected speech under the First Amendment to the authorities. The bill violated Fourth Amendment by allowing the Government to skirt the warrant requirements for searching the contents of communications by forcing companies to hand over user communications and information as agents of the state. Given those problems, the legislation did not progress and is unlikely to get much traction in 2016. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;That said, it’s hard to escape the conclusion that having had her clearly unconstitutional bill go nowhere when it was introduced last summer, Sen. Feinstein is using the bill’s recent reintroduction as leverage to pressure companies to change their policies in the wake of the Paris attacks and the San Bernardino shootings.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sen. Feinstein has given several &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/247269-senate-spy-bill-tells-tech-treat-terror-like-child-porn&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;interviews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; demanding that tech companies immediately change their policies and stop the spread of ISIS influence online. Although seeking to limit ISIS’ hateful message is an admirable goal as part of counterterrorism strategy, using private companies to bypass the First Amendment is not the way to do it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the government uses its power to coerce private companies into stifling speech, it is not only wrong, it’s unconstitutional. According to the Supreme Court as well as a recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/sheriffs-threats-against-credit-card-companies-violate-first-amendment&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;unanimous opinion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by the &lt;/span&gt;Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the First Amendment prohibits public officials from using their office to intimidate private parties, including tech companies, into taking particular actions.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, the threat of Sen. Feinstein’s bill to actively police users’ content seems &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-shooting-socialmedia-insig-idUSKBN0TO0OS20151207&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;to be working&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If companies are already removing content in violation of their terms, added government pressure provides an incentive to implement an overbroad and censorious regime that infringes on users’ free speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tech Companies are Not Created to Investigate Terrorism &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Moving forward, EFF hopes that tech companies will resist efforts to become agents of the government. The promise of free speech on social networks is in part what allowed these companies to become the global leaders that they are, and we hope they’ll remember that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Moreover, companies should resist government pressure because they&lt;span&gt; are incredibly bad at policing their users’ content. Rather than enacting rational policies, they tend to over-censor. For instance, as part of Facebook’s efforts to remove content about the terrorist group ISIS on its network, the company also locked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/18/facebook-thinks-im-a-terrorist-woman-named-isis-has-account-disabled&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/ontario-teen-isis-king-faces-bullying-facebook-ban-over-her-name-1.3005014&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; out of their account for having the name “Isis,” one of whom was already being bullied because of her name. Given these problems and companies’ arbitrary removal of user content in a number of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinecensorship.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;other contexts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, finding and investigating potential threats to our country should be left in the hands of the professionals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Some even argue that if these companies remove or over-report content, it will harm legitimate intelligence gathering and terrorism investigations. A former undercover FBI agent quoted by &lt;i&gt;the Intercept &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2015/12/17/senators-want-social-media-firms-to-hunt-for-terrorists/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;explains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; how over-reporting “creates this tidal wave of information… cast[s] suspicion on a lot of people unnecessarily, which is then impossible to remove.” Thus, the government’s call for greater reporting may actually be counterproductive to identifying actual terrorists online.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;As the government continues to pressure tech companies, EFF stands ready to support those that resist, and we hope that they will publicly stand up for their users’ free speech rights.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Protecting the Choice to Speak Anonymously Is Key to Fighting Online Harassment</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/press/releases/protecting-choice-speak-anonymously-key-fighting-online-harassment</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-pr-subhead field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;EFF Urges Department of Education to Uphold First Amendment Rights in University Anti-Harassment Policies&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) urged the Department of Education today to protect university students’ right to speak anonymously online, warning that curtailing anonymous speech as part of anti-harassment regulations would not only violate the Constitution but also jeopardize important on-campus activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Battling gender and racial harassment and threats on college campuses is vitally important,” said EFF Legal Director Corynne McSherry. “But some are calling for blanket bans on the use of platforms that allow anonymous comments, and that’s a counterproductive strategy. Online anonymity is crucial for students who fear retaliation for their political and social commentary. It helps many people avoid being targets of harassment in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF’s &lt;a href=&quot;/document/effs-letter-office-civil-rights&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to the Department of Education comes after a number of groups pressed for new federal guidelines for fighting online harassment. EFF agrees with the majority of the recommendations, including ensuring prompt reporting and investigation of all reports of harassment, and disciplining and/or prosecuting perpetrators. However, preemptively removing access to anonymous online speech platforms violates all students’ First Amendment rights—threatening projects like the USG Girl Mafia at the University of Southern California, where students anonymously map locations of assault reports on campus. Anonymity was also essential for student activists at Guilford College in North Carolina, who used an online form to collect anonymous testimonials about racial violence from those who felt unsafe revealing their identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, online speech bans are problematic because any technical restriction—like blocking on-campus access through the university’s wireless network, or limiting where students can access particular mobile applications or websites—will not prevent any student from going off-campus or joining another wireless network to comment anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Internet has an unmatched ability to help groups of people organize and communicate and be a force for positive social change,” said EFF Frank Stanton Legal Fellow Aaron Mackey. “Taking away choices for anonymous speech will curtail these activities without meaningfully preventing illegal harassment and threats. We urge the Department of Education to find solutions that protect all students.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The State of the Union, Ignoring the Elephant in the Room</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/state-union-ignoring-elephant-room</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2016/01/13/sotu-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;265&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-union-2016-president-obamas-full-prepared-remarks/story?id=36254316&quot;&gt;State of the Union address&lt;/a&gt; examined a great many pressing issues confronting our nation and the world. One of the most dire, however, somehow escaped his attention: the continuing threat to democracy presented by unaccountable, secret mass surveillance in violation of the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President’s promise to rethink security policies hastily adopted under his predecessor was a significant part of his platform when he ran for the White House. During his first presidential campaign back in 2008, President Obama made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barack-obama/my-position-on-fisa_b_110789.html&quot;&gt;written promise&lt;/a&gt; to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;conduct a comprehensive review of all our surveillance programs, and to make further recommendations on any steps needed to preserve civil liberties and to prevent executive branch abuse in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even after the Snowden revelations, mass surveillance by the National Security Agency remains largely unchecked. With a year remaining in its final term, the Obama administration has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/dragnet-nsa-spying-survives-2015-review&quot;&gt;failed to implement&lt;/a&gt; the wide-ranging reforms necessary, as the President eight years ago promised in writing, &quot;to preserve civil liberties and to prevent executive branch abuse in the future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, President Obama did order a review of signal intelligence programs soon after he entered office, and then convened a &lt;a href=&quot;http://icontherecord.tumblr.com/post/60323228143/review-group-on-global-signals-intelligence&quot;&gt;Review Group on Global Signals Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; after the Snowden revelations in 2013. It produced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2013-12-12_rg_final_report.pdf&quot;&gt;300 page report&lt;/a&gt; that deeply explored the issues and made 46 specific recommendations. The review group’s proposed reforms were impressive, but they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/18/nsa-review-panel-surveillance-questions&quot;&gt;left much&lt;/a&gt; to be desired and, in any case, only a minuscule fraction have found their way into policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, during President Obama’s tenure, the Justice Department has continued to respond to court challenges asserting the privacy rights of Americans—including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying&quot;&gt;cases filed by EFF&lt;/a&gt;—with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/wikimedia-v-nsa-another-court-blinds-itself-mass-nsa-surveillance&quot;&gt;delay and obfuscation&lt;/a&gt;, avoiding judicial review on the merits and hiding behind essentially lawless claims of unfettered executive secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration&#039;s claims in court, alongside its unprecedented and relentless &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bravenewfilms.org/waronwhistleblowers&quot;&gt;persecution of journalists and government whistleblowers&lt;/a&gt; who risk their careers to empower the public, fly in the face of the transparency to which the president has repeatedly recommitted himself and his administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the nation&#039;s top intelligence official offered &lt;a href=&quot;http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/making-alberto-gonzales-look-good/%3F_r=0&quot;&gt;false statements&lt;/a&gt; in response to direct congressional questions about whether millions of Americans are being monitored by our government. Despite being discredited by the Snowden revelations, James Clapper continues to enjoy the President&#039;s confidence and to serve in the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To his credit, President Obama supported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/new-usa-freedom-act-step-right-direction-more-must-be-done&quot;&gt;an initial set of important yet incomplete reforms&lt;/a&gt; enacted into law last year. It was the first time in 40 years that Congress had moved to restrain recurring—and ongoing—domestic abuses by our nation’s intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If America is to truly be a land of the free, Congress must continue to explore what the executive branch has refused to reveal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/07/secrecy-system-veers-absurdity-politicians-argue-more&quot;&gt;reform the broken classification system&lt;/a&gt;, and then go &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/fighting-privacy-two-years-after-snowden&quot;&gt;beyond transparency&lt;/a&gt; to impose meaningful protections for privacy, dissent, and civil liberties. Having recently learned that their own communications were subjected to lawless government monitoring, perhaps members of Congress will see fit in 2016 to finally ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/note-congress-nsa-seizes-more-just-your-conversations-israeli-leaders&quot;&gt;the questions that no one has yet answered&lt;/a&gt; in public.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You Can&#039;t Destroy the Village to Save It: W3C vs DRM, Round Two</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/you-cant-destroy-village-save-it-w3c-vs-drm-round-two</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the nonprofit body that maintains the Web&#039;s core standards, made a terrible mistake in 2013: they decided to add DRM—the digital locks that train your computer to say &quot;I can&#039;t let you do that, Dave&quot;; rather than &quot;Yes, boss&quot;—to the Web&#039;s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/lowering-your-standards&quot;&gt;we fought the proposal on a principled basis&lt;/a&gt;: DRM has no place in the open Internet because of the many ways it shuts down legal, legitimate activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we came back with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/objection-rechartering-w3c-eme-group&quot;&gt;a new proposal&lt;/a&gt;: the W3C could have its cake and eat it too. It could adopt a rule that requires members who help make DRM standards to promise not to sue people who report bugs in tools that conform to those standards, nor could they sue people just for making a standards-based tool that connected to theirs. They could make DRM, but only if they made sure that they took steps to stop that DRM from being used to attack the open Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nowhere near as good as the W3C rejecting DRM altogether, but it&#039;s &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better than nothing. If the W3C is going to create new DRM standards, let them make them in a way that minimizes the risk to security researchers and standards-implementers, the people that the W3C exists to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve asked the W3C to make this into their policy. The only W3C group presently engaged in DRM standardization is due to have its charter renewed in early 2016. The W3C called a poll over that charter during the Christmas month, ending on December 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the tight timeline and the number of members who were unavailable over the holidays, a global, diverse coalition of commercial firms, nonprofits and educational institutions came together to endorse this proposal. More than three quarters of those who weighed in on our proposal supported it. Those supporters include Stanford University, the Open University, the University of Southampton, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-eff-open-approach-to-security-will-define-next-chapter-of-finance/&quot;&gt;Ripple (a payments company)&lt;/a&gt;, the Hypothes.is project and several others all said that they would not agree with the group being rechartered at all unless EFF&#039;s covenenant were made a condition of participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal is now in the hands of the W3C&#039;s executive, specifically W3C CEO Jeff Jaffe and Director Tim Berners-Lee. They have it in their power to substantially mitigate some of the worst potential effects of DRM at the W3C. If the W3C adopts EFF&#039;s proposal, they will be saying to the companies that push for DRM: &quot;You are welcome to standardize any technology in our group, but you must promise not to use that work to sue programmers for doing normal things that are important to the Web&#039;s openness and survival.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2016/01/08/2000px-hal9000.svg_.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why DRM is a bad technology for open standardization, you need to understand the laws that protect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, laws like the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Canada&#039;s C-11, New Zealand&#039;s Bill 92A; and accords like the European EUCD, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, and the US-Australian and US-Korean Trade Agreements establish special legal protections for DRM. These governments (and many others) give legal backing to companies that try to lock you out of devices, software, and media that you own, and this interferes with activities like repairing your own electronics or your car, making backups or remixes of videos, auditing the security of medical devices, and many more legitimate and otherwise-lawful activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse. In practice, it&#039;s not hard to break DRM, so to slow the spread of information about how to remove the locks on the stuff you own, laws like the DMCA also has been used to punish disclosure of bugs and defects. This doesn&#039;t mean that bad guys—enemy spies, cyber arms-dealers, voyeurs, identity thieves, and griefers—don&#039;t discover and weaponize these bugs. It just means that you don&#039;t get to learn about them until they are used in a high-profile attack, or until a brave security researcher risks a lawsuit to come forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While DRM has many other failings, these two are especially pointed in the context of Web standards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. DRM is incompatible with interoperability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interoperability—plugging one thing into another—is why standards exist. Sometimes, vendors welcome interop, offering APIs and other hooks for follow-on tools to plug into. Sometimes, manufacturers don&#039;t bother, or actively try to block third party equipment from playing nice with their own (think of inkjet printer cartridges). In the absence of DRM, it&#039;s perfectly legit (and common) for manufacturers to figure out how to let you plug something they make into something you own, even when this goes against the wishes of the original manufacturer. You bought it, you own it, you get to decide what you plug into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRM exists to stop users from doing things they want to do and to stop innovative companies from helping users do things they want to do -- or would want to do, if they had the option. Your cable box, for example, will be designed to stop you from recording your favorite shows for long-term storage and viewing on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you could just plug any digital video recorder into your cable box, you could record those shows, move them to your laptop, and watch them ten years from now. DRM locks up the data coming out of your cable box with encryption that is arguably unlawful to break, even to do something legal, like make a copy for personal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s not unusual: tech companies have dreamed of the &quot;toaster-maker gets to sell you the bread&quot; business since forever. The common response to this is for a competing manufacturer to design a widget that converts the proprietary, locked output from your gadget into a standard, open one, that can accept a variety of apps, recorders, lightbulbs, bread, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRM laws put a roadblock in the way of this innovation. So DRM only exists to &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; compatibility without explicit permission—the opposite of a standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. DRM is a security disaster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prohibition on reporting bugs in systems with DRM makes those bugs last longer, and get exploited harder before they&#039;re patched. Last summer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/library-congress-2015-dmca-1201-rules&quot;&gt;the US Copyright Office collected evidence&lt;/a&gt; about DRM interfering with reporting bugs in tractors, cars, medical implants, and critical national infrastructure. The W3C&#039;s roadmap for HTML5 is for it to have the flexibility and power to replace apps as the default way to control all those devices and more. If standards-compliant browsers have legal barriers to reporting vulnerabilities in them, it exposes the whole technological world and everything we do in it at risk of attacks that can&#039;t be headed off until it&#039;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the eminent security researchers who participated in the Copyright Office&#039;s latest rulemaking to consider exemptions to Section 1201 of the US DMCA have endorsed EFF&#039;s proposal for a nonagression covenant, including Bruce Schneier, Matthew Blaze and Matthew Green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2016/01/08/2000px-hal9000.svg_.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#039;t the first collision between proprietary rights and the W3C. In 1999, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2007/Talks/0507-patent-policy-overview/#%284%29&quot;&gt;the W3C had to decide what to do about software patents&lt;/a&gt;. These patents were and are hugely controversial, and the W3C was looking for a way to be neutral on the question of whether patents were good or bad, while still protecting the Web&#039;s openness to anyone who wanted to develop for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They came up with a brilliant strategy: a patent nonaggression policy—a policy we modelled our DRM proposal on. Under this policy, participation in a W3C group meant that you had to promise your company wouldn&#039;t use its patents to sue over anything that group produced. This policy let the W3C take a position on the open Web (the Web is more open when your risk of getting sued for making it better is reduced) without taking a policy on whether patents are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DRM covenant does the same thing. Without taking a position on DRM, it takes the inarguable position that the Web gets more open when the number of people who can sue you for reporting bugs in it or connecting new things to it goes down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Wide Web Consortium is at a crossroads. Much of the &quot;Web&quot; is disappearing into apps and into the big companies&#039; walled gardens. If it is to be relevant in the decades to come, it must do everything it can to keep the Web open as an &lt;em&gt;alternative&lt;/em&gt; to those walled gardens. We&#039;re trying hard to help them do that. But if the W3C executive won&#039;t take the lead on keeping the Web open, they must, at a minimum, not impede those who haven&#039;t given up the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>House Grills State Department Over Wassenaar Arrangement</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/house-grills-state-department-over-wassenaar-arrangement</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Congressional Representatives grilled the parties responsible for the U.S. implementation of controversial changes to the Wassenaar Arrangement in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/wassenaar-cybersecurity-and-export-control/&quot;&gt;joint hearing before subcommittees of the House Oversight and Homeland Security Committees&lt;/a&gt; today. Witnesses included officials from the Department of Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of State, as well as representatives of the tech industry, including Symantec, Microsoft, VMWare, and the Information Technology Industry Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Today’s hearing was a response to the overwhelmingly negative reception to the Commerce Department’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/we-must-fight-proposed-us-wassenaar-implementation&quot;&gt;proposed implementation&lt;/a&gt; of the Wassenaar Arrangement. Not only did civil society organizations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/eff-commerce-department-we-must-revise-overbroad-export-control-proposal&quot;&gt;including EFF&lt;/a&gt;, voice their concerns about the overbreadth of the proposed language and its potential effects on security research, but the tech industry also rose in opposition. The companies argued—and we agree—that the proposed rules would not only weaken our entire digital infrastructure, but hamper U.S companies’ competitiveness in the global security market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In addition to calling for this hearing, Representatives &lt;a href=&quot;https://mccaul.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/mccaul-and-langevin-urge-administration-to-weigh-in-on-wassenaar&quot;&gt;McCaul and Langevin sent a letter&lt;/a&gt; to Obama’s National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, urging the administration to greatly narrow the current proposed rule, or risk grave harm to both research and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Members of Congress and witnesses from the tech industry appear to be largely united against the rulemaking. Iain Mulholland, speaking for VMWare said, “Ultimately, the U.S. should return to Wassenaar and renegotiate the 2013 agreement.” Cristin Flynn Goodwin, speaking for Microsoft, suggested that “the administration should suspend any further rulemaking until a new agreement can be reached.” Congressman Mike Kelly (R-PA) put it even more succinctly, “BIS should reconsider the rulemaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Everyone at today’s hearing agreed that the initial proposed rule needs revision. Kevin Wolf, the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration at the Department of Commerce came right out and said that “the next step will not be a final rule.” But exactly what the next step will be remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;While we were heartened that both the committee members and the industry representatives were in agreement that the U.S. needs to go back and renegotiate the Wassenaar Arrangement&#039;s language, we didn’t hear the administration actually commit to doing so. State Department officials at the hearing openly admitted that the first version of the U.S. proposal “missed the mark” and that they were “surprised” by the tech industry’s negative reaction. However, the State Department refrained from making any promises, merely placating Representatives by saying “all options are on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From EFF’s perspective, there is only one option: the 2013 changes to the Wassenaar Arrangement must be renegotiated. Either rolled back entirely, or at a minimum, greatly narrowed to reduce their negative impact on security research.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Keys Case Spotlights Flaws of Computer Hacking Law</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/keys-case-spotlights-flaws-computer-hacking-law</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2016/01/12/cfaa-keys-social-media_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;341&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old laws can cause confusion and unduly harsh consequences, particularly when courts confront situations Congress did not anticipate. This is particularly true for the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030—the federal &quot;anti­hacking&quot; statute prompted in part by fear generated by the 1983 techno­thriller &quot;WarGames.&quot; The CFAA was enacted in 1986, and the government&#039;s current prosecution of journalist Matthew Keys—who faces sentencing on Jan. 20 for three counts of violating the CFAA—illustrates the 30-­year­-old statute&#039;s many problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFAA makes it illegal to intentionally access a &quot;protected computer&quot;—which includes any computer connected to the Internet—&quot;without authorization&quot; or in excess of authorization. But the CFAA does not define &quot;without authorization.&quot; This has given overzealous prosecutors broad discretion to bring criminal charges against individuals for behavior that simply doesn&#039;t rise to the culpability Congress had in mind when it passed this serious criminal law, such as doing something on a computer network that the owner doesn&#039;t like. (There is currently a circuit split on whether violations of employer­imposed use restrictions can give rise to CFAA liability, with the U.S. Courts of Appeal for the Second, Fourth and Ninth Circuits finding that they cannot, and the First, Fifth, Seventh and Eleventh finding that they can.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Keys case centers on behavior that essentially amounts to Internet vandalism. After being fired from the Tribune Company, Keys shared the username and password of the Tribune Company&#039;s content management system in an online chat room. Another individual then used the credentials to log into the CMS and make some juvenile but relatively innocuous changes to a &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; article, including modifying the title of the article to read &quot;Pressure builds in House to elect CHIPPY 1337&quot; (from &quot;Pressure builds in house to pass tax­cut package&quot;). The changes were live for only about 40 minutes, after which the Tribune Company restored the original article and effectively blocked outside access to its CMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government charged Keys with three felony counts under the CFAA: (i) conspiracy to cause damage to a protected computer; (ii) transmission of computer code that resulted in unauthorized damage; and (iii) attempted transmission of malicious code to cause unauthorized damage. Keys was convicted on all three counts and now faces a maximum 25­year prison sentence—10 years each for the first two offenses and 5 years for the third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is a stark example of how prosecutors are using the CFAA to get harsher punishments than they could get for analogous crimes in the physical world. One reason the Second Circuit recently joined the Fourth and Ninth Circuits in holding that the CFAA does not apply to violations of employer­-imposed use restrictions was the court&#039;s recognition that prosecutors should not have such broad discretion: &quot;A court should not uphold a highly problematic interpretation of a statute merely because the government promises to use it responsibly.&quot; &lt;em&gt;United States v. Valle&lt;/em&gt;, __ F.3d __, 2015 WL 7774548, *19 (2d Cir. Dec. 3, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly rein in prosecutorial discretion under the CFAA—and to avoid &quot;transform[ing] the CFAA from an anti­-hacking statute into an expansive misappropriation statute[,]&quot; &lt;em&gt;United States v. Nosal&lt;/em&gt;, 676 F.3d 854, 857 (9th Cir. 2012)—courts must observe the rule of lenity and limit application of the phrase &quot;without authorization&quot; in a way that captures Congress&#039; &quot;anti­-hacking&quot; intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compounding the problem, the CFAA has a disproportionately harsh penalty scheme. First time offenses are currently punishable by up to five years in prison, plus fines. Other violations are punishable by up to ten years, twenty years, or even life in prison. Maximum punishments are sometimes just a ploy to induce a defendant into a plea bargain or capture the public&#039;s attention, as we saw in the government&#039;s tragic case against Aaron Swartz. Aaron, facing up to 35 years in prison pursuant to the CFAA&#039;s harsh penalty scheme, took his own life. But maximums also impact the ultimate sentence imposed, as they are viewed as a sign of the severity of the crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Keys faces up to 25 years in federal prison, even while a prosecutor on the case publicly acknowledged that &quot;[t]his is not the crime of the century.&quot; The government has in fact signaled—but not promised—that it will &quot;likely&quot; seek less than five years, but even that seems too much for a 40­ minute prank. A recent public survey measuring people&#039;s beliefs about authorization and appropriate punishments for a variety of computer misuse activities confirms that the CFAA&#039;s penalties are drastically out of touch with lay instincts about the culpability of &quot;unauthorized&quot; computer access. While those surveyed generally thought of checking a weather report at work as &quot;unauthorized,&quot; 60 percent nevertheless thought it should not be punished at all, while 32 percent thought it should be punished with the equivalent of a parking ticket. &lt;em&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Matthew Kugler, &quot;Measuring Computer Use Norms,&quot; Geo. Wash. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2016). And without sensible judicial interpretations of the CFAA&#039;s broad language, the law will keep drifting further from how we use computers today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, some courts have gone in the wrong direction, paving the way for exorbitant punishments. For example, certain provisions of the CFAA require a showing of loss or damage. The statute defines &quot;damage&quot; as &quot;any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information,&quot; and &quot;loss&quot; as &quot;any reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages incurred because of interruption of service[.]&quot; &lt;em&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(8), (11). Courts have interpreted &quot;cost of responding to an offense&quot; and &quot;conducting a damage assessment&quot; to include costs associated with investigation of an offense and subsequent remedial measures—with no requirement that these be reasonable or proportionate to the type of unauthorized access alleged. Both prosecutors and civil plaintiffs have taken advantage of this. And because the amount of damage or loss claimed can impact the severity of a sentence, the abusive use of trumped­-up loss claims is particularly problematic when paired with the CFAA&#039;s already unduly harsh penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Keys case, for instance, the government has argued that the Tribune Company incurred losses of $929,977.00. This includes fees for a lawyer who, according to WIRED magazine, was told by a Tribune Company manager, &quot;if you bill $1,000 an hour, that would help us get this prosecuted.&quot; At trial, the manager claimed that this was just a joke about the lawyer&#039;s high billing rates. Either way, it seems dubious that it legitimately cost the Tribune Company almost a million dollars to deal with an article that was &quot;defaced&quot; for approximately 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet vandalism, while not commendable, should not give rise to charges that carry the potential of a 25­-year prison sentence. The Keys case shows what many of us have known for years: it&#039;s time for courts to take serious steps to ensure that the CFAA is consistently interpreted narrowly, in line with the rule of lenity, and, if they do not, for Congress to take up the task of CFAA reform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In Patent Litigation, Justice Delayed Ensures the Entire Public Can Be Denied</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/patent-litigation-justice-delayed-ensures-entire-public-can-be-denied</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When courts fail to quickly address serious defects in a patent litigation complaint, it can harm not only the parties to the case, but also the public at large. Yesterday, EFF and Public Knowledge filed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2016/01/12/brief-eclipse-mandamus.pdf&quot;&gt;friend-of-the-court brief&lt;/a&gt; with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in a case where the Eastern District of Texas is allowing expensive litigation to drag on even though the defendant has already fully briefed validity issues that almost surely will dispose of the case, and stop the patent owner from suing on them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipse IP, the patent owner in this case, is a repeat patent assertor. It’s brought over 160 cases in recent years. (Eclipse IP recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/psa-shipping-and-transit-llc-and-electronic-communication-technologies-llc-are-not&quot;&gt;changed its name&lt;/a&gt; to Electronic Communication Technologies, LLC, but the named party in this case is still Eclipse IP.) The defendant in this case, Marten Transport, is a trucking company based in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April, Eclipse IP sued Marten Transport in the Eastern District of Texas for allegedly infringing two of its patents: U.S. Patent No. &lt;a href=&quot;https://patents.google.com/patent/US7876239B2/en&quot;&gt;7,876,239&lt;/a&gt; and U.S. Patent No. &lt;a href=&quot;https://patents.google.com/patent/US7479899B2/en&quot;&gt;7,479,899&lt;/a&gt;. This wasn’t the first time Eclipse IP has sued on one or both of these patents. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lexmachina.com/&quot;&gt;Lex Machina&lt;/a&gt; (a patent litigation data reporting service) reports that the former patent has been involved in 109 lawsuits and the latter in 91.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the remarkable number of cases involving these patents, Lex Machina also reports that there has never been&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; substantive ruling as to these patents or the validity of Eclipse IP’s claims of infringement. Cases seem to have a general pattern of quickly settling after the lawsuit has been filed. Unfortunately, because settlement information is usually not public, we don’t know whether or exactly how much money changed hands. (We do know that in one case, Eclipse IP asked for $95,000 from the defendant and that it has sent &lt;a href=&quot;https://trollingeffects.org/demand/eclipse-ip-llc-2015-01-28&quot;&gt;letters&lt;/a&gt; demanding payment of $45,000, amounts well below the cost of litigation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, however, many defendants have been filing “&lt;i&gt;Alice&lt;/i&gt;” motions when faced with particularly bad patents like Eclipse IP’s. These motions ask the court to find that the patents are facially invalid because they claim “abstract ideas,” which aren’t patentable under the Supreme Court’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/bad-day-bad-patents-supreme-court-unanimously-strikes-down-abstract-software&quot;&gt;2014 decision&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Alice v. CLS Bank&lt;/i&gt;. Generally, these motions have been pretty successful across the country in getting courts to more quickly and efficiently weed out bad patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, a dozen defendants had been consolidated into one case and nine of these defendants each filed an &lt;i&gt;Alice&lt;/i&gt; motion. This was not surprising. As we noted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/stupid-patent-month-eclipse-ip-casts-shadow-over-innovation&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, Eclipse IP had claims from three related patents &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6853951770054804078&amp;amp;q&quot;&gt;invalidated&lt;/a&gt; by a court in California. The court in California did this on the pleadings, meaning it avoided expensive discovery and limited the costs imposed on the defendants (the judge in those cases explained that he was concerned that Eclipse IP was “leveraging the cost of litigation, rather than the strength of its patents” to get settlements). If there was ever a case that the court could and should rule early and quickly, Eclipse’s case against Marten Transport was it. (One of the patents, U.S. Patent No. &lt;a href=&quot;https://patents.google.com/patent/US7119716B2/en&quot;&gt;7,119,716&lt;/a&gt;, has now-invalidated claims that are strikingly similar in scope to the patents being used against Marten Transport.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Despite nine defendants filing &lt;i&gt;Alice &lt;/i&gt;motions, the Eastern District of Texas has not ruled on a single one. In fact, while the motions were pending, all of the defendants except Marten Transport settled. It has now been over six months since Marten filed its original &lt;i&gt;Alice &lt;/i&gt;motion (Marten Transport had to refile it a month after originally filing in virtually the same form when Eclipse IP filed a new complaint). Since that time, Marten Transport has had to bear significant litigation costs. Marten Transport has repeatedly asked the court to rule on its &lt;i&gt;Alice&lt;/i&gt; motion (as well as a motion to transfer) but the court has not acted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, Marten Transport asked the Federal Circuit to order the Eastern District of Texas to rule on its &lt;i&gt;Alice &lt;/i&gt;motion and its motion to transfer. In a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandamus&quot;&gt;petition for writ of mandamus&lt;/a&gt;,” Marten Transport &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2016/01/12/petition_for_writ_of_mandamus.pdf&quot;&gt;highlights&lt;/a&gt; that the case should not be in the Eastern District of Texas in the first place (Eclipse IP is based in Florida, Marten Transport is based in Wisconsin, making it clear the case should not be in Texas); and that the Court should rule on its &lt;i&gt;Alice &lt;/i&gt;motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree. In our friend-of-the-court brief, we note how failing to rule allows a case to continue that almost surely should not. The defendant has to spend time and money on issues that are unnecessary to fully resolve the case. What’s more, there’s evidence that improper patent assertion harms innovation by making the defendant and others less likely to innovate for fear of more patent assertion.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, failing to rule allows Eclipse IP to continue asserting its patent against countless others. So long as a court never actually looks at Eclipse IP’s patent to determine its validity, Eclipse IP can keep suing and demanding quick settlements. Thus not only is Marten Transport harmed by litigating a case it should never have been dragged into, so is the public at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6860254007903008441&quot;&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; has repeatedly emphasized the public policy of having patent validity determined by the courts when it is raised. Otherwise, it increases “the opportunities for holders of invalid patents to exact licensing agreements or other settlements from alleged infringers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think it is especially important in cases brought by entities like Eclipse IP.  While we understand courts are busy and it may not be possible to quickly rule on motions, a better course of action would be to stay expensive discovery until that motion is decided (one way or the other). Patent owners should not be allowed to exploit a court’s failure to rule on a motion to bring hundreds of lawsuits where they use the cost of litigation to extract settlements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EFF To Court: Cisco Must Be Held Accountable For Aiding China’s Human Rights Abuses</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-court-cisco-must-be-held-accountable-aiding-chinas-human-rights-abuses</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-pr-subhead field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Company Built Customized ‘Golden Shield’ System to Identify Falun Gong Members Who Were Later Tortured&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;San Francisco—The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is urging a federal appeals court to reinstate a lawsuit seeking to hold Cisco Systems accountable for aiding in human rights abuses by building the Chinese government a system that Cisco officials knew was intended to identify—and facilitate the capture and torture of—members of the Falun Gong religious minority.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In an &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/eff-article-19-privacy-international-9th-circuit-amicus-brief&quot;&gt;amicus brief&lt;/a&gt; filed Monday with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, EFF and the groups ARTICLE 19 and Privacy International argue that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that Cisco understood that the “Golden Shield” system (also known as The Great Firewall) it custom-built for China was an essential component of the government’s program of persecution against the Falun Gong—persecution that included online spying and tracking, detention, and torture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Doe v. Cisco Systems Inc., &lt;/i&gt;Falun Gong victims and their families sued Cisco under a law known as the Alien Tort Statute, which allows noncitizens to bring claims in U.S. federal court for violations of human rights laws. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;A federal judge dismissed the case, saying the plaintiffs didn’t offer enough support for their claim that Cisco knew the customized features of the Golden Shield enabling the identification and apprehension of Falun Gong practitioners specifically would ultimately lead to torture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As EFF explains in its brief, the judge misapplied the law. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The facts alleged by the plaintiffs are sufficient to proceed with a lawsuit claiming Cisco knew that technologies it designed from its offices in San Jose, California, would facilitate human rights abuses, and purposefully built its products to help the Chinese government carry out its program of repressing, capturing, and abusing Falun Gong members,” said EFF Staff Attorney Sophia Cope. “Company officials didn’t have to be present in China in order to assist human rights violations, and victims have a right to their day in court.’’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Golden Shield system included a library of Falun Gong Internet activity enabling the Chinese government to identify Falun Gong members online, according to the lawsuit. The case also contains strong evidence that &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/eff-asks-court-allow-human-rights-case-against-cisco-building-surveillance-tools&quot;&gt;Cisco created systems&lt;/a&gt; for storing and sharing information about “forced conversion”—i.e. torture—sessions for use as training tools. The cooperation was also documented in internal marketing literature, where a Cisco engineer described the company’s commitment to China’s security objectives, including the “&lt;i&gt;douzheng&lt;/i&gt;” of Falun Gong practitioners. &lt;i&gt;Douzheng&lt;/i&gt; is a term describing abuse campaigns against disfavored groups comprising of persecution and torture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“Cisco’s conduct is part of a growing trend of U.S. and European technology companies helping repressive governments become highly efficient at committing human rights violations,” said Cope. “We are asking the Ninth Circuit to recognize that victims of such abuses can seek to hold accomplices like Cisco accountable for their role in brutal persecutions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Boy Who Could Change the World</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/boy-who-could-change-world</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2016/01/11/aaron-social-graphic2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Celebrating the Life and Words of Aaron Swartz&quot; height=&quot;325&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the minor puzzles of American life is what question to ask people at parties and suchly to get to know them,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/smalltalkq&quot;&gt;a nineteen-year-old Aaron Swartz wrote in 2006&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘How ya doin’?’ is of course mere formality, only the most troubled would answer honestly for anything but the positive. […] ‘What do you do?’ is somewhat offensive.” Aaron walks through various other options—“Where are you from?” “What’s your major?” “What book have you read recently?”—and articulates why each one fails to start a worthwhile discussion. And then he offers his own hack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I propose instead that one ask “What have you been thinking about lately?” First, the question is extremely open-ended. The answer could be a book, a movie, a relationship, a class, a job, a hobby, etc. Even better, it will be whichever of these is most interesting at the moment. Second, it sends the message that thinking, and thinking about thinking, is a fundamental human activity, and thus encourages it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;align-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/162097066X/?tag=electronicfro-20&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2016/01/11/boy_who_could_change_the_world_final.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Boy Who Could Change the World&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of Aaron’s ideas, what makes his conversation-starter useful is that it brings out the best in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron was a programmer, activist, entrepreneur, community builder, and a dear friend of EFF. In 2013, while being unfairly prosecuted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, he took his own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Aaron’s writings have now been elegantly collected in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/162097066X/?tag=electronicfro-20&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Boy Who Could Change the World: The Writings of Aaron Swartz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The book is a joy to read—partially because his ideas and the way he wrote about them were so compelling, but also because you get to see his thinking develop and change from his teenage years into adulthood. And he thought about a lot—everything from copyright law to privacy to political tactics to music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, on the third anniversary of his death, let’s take a moment to celebrate Aaron’s life by reflecting on a few of his words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“It’s the Outsiders Who Provide Nearly All of the Content”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the book—and throughout Aaron’s Life—there’s a strong theme: technology shouldn’t just be for techies. Tech can, and should, benefit everyone. He played key roles in the development of Creative Commons, RSS, and RDF, all technologies that are inherently about making information accessible to more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book are several blog posts documenting Aaron’s unsuccessful 2006 run for the Wikimedia board of directors. He shares what was a minority opinion among the Wikimedia community at the time: that it’s outsiders, not loyal Wikipedians, that make the most important contributions to the free encyclopedia (Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales had frequently argued the opposite).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron explains how he tested Wales’ assertion—counting not the total number of edits each user had made to an article, but who’d made the most substantive contributions to the current version of that article. He found that the largest contributions were made not by Wikipedia insiders, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia&quot;&gt;but by subject matter experts who didn’t live and breathe Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you put it all together, the story becomes clear: an outsider makes one edit to add a chunk of information, then insiders make several edits tweaking and reformatting it. In addition, insiders rack up thousands of edits doing things like changing the name of a category across the entire site — the kind of thing only insiders deeply care about. As a result, insiders account for the vast majority of the edits. But it’s the outsiders who provide nearly all of the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you think about it, this makes perfect sense. Writing an encyclopedia is hard. To do anywhere near a decent job, you have to know a great deal of information about an incredibly wide variety of subjects. Writing so much text is difficult, but doing all the background research seems impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, everyone has a bunch of obscure things that, for one reason or another, they’ve come to know well. So they share them, clicking the edit link and adding a paragraph or two to Wikipedia. At the same time, a small number of people have become particularly involved in Wikipedia itself, learning its policies and special syntax, and spending their time tweaking the contributions of everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In subsequent posts, Aaron asked how Wikipedia could be optimized to bring in more expert contributors, rather than targeting its community-building efforts at a smaller, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedians&quot;&gt;dedicated core of Wikipedians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those same concerns about tech designed for insiders come up elsewhere too. In his post “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rlrr&quot;&gt;Release Late, Release Rarely&lt;/a&gt;,” Aaron questions the “release early, release often” dogma popular among coders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Releasing means showing it to the world. There’s nothing wrong with showing it to friends or experts or even random people in a coffee shop. The friends will give you the emotional support you would have gotten from actual users, without the stress. The experts will point out most of the errors the world would have found, without the insults. And random people will not only give you most of the complaints the public would, they’ll also tell you why the public gave up even before bothering to complain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why “release early, release often” works in “open source”: you’re releasing to a community of insiders. Programmers know what it’s like to write programs and they don’t mind using things that are unpolished. They can see what you’re going to do next and maybe help you get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public isn’t like that. Don’t treat them like they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Just Giving People Information Isn’t Enough”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, that firm belief that information should benefit everyone cost Aaron his life. When he committed suicide, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/aaron-swartz-fix-draconian-computer-crime-law&quot;&gt;he was facing severe penalties&lt;/a&gt; for accessing millions of articles via MIT’s computer network without “authorization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book includes the 2008 &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guerilla Open Access Manifesto&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while noting that Aaron’s role in writing it—and the degree to which it reflected his views—is the subject of some controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It&#039;s outrageous and unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I agree,&quot; many say, &quot;but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it&#039;s perfectly legal — there&#039;s nothing we can do to stop them.&quot; But there is something we can, something that&#039;s already being done: we can fight back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists — you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also clear, though, that Aaron didn’t see access to information as only an end in itself. Aaron championed open government through his project watchdog.net, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/watchdog&quot;&gt;even at the time that he launched it&lt;/a&gt;, he knew that transparency alone wouldn’t build a more just society:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just giving people information isn’t enough; unless you give them an opportunity to do something about it, it will just make them more apathetic. So the second part of the site is building tools to let people take action: write or call your representative, send a note to local papers, post a story about something interesting you’ve found, generate a scorecard for the next election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Aaron discovered that the most powerful way that we can use technology to fight corruption isn’t primarily about transparency, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/usefultransparency&quot;&gt;it’s about collaboration&lt;/a&gt;—the same kind of open collaboration he’d championed at Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting databases online isn’t a silver bullet, as nice as the word &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt; may sound. But it was easy to delude myself. All I had to do was keep putting things online and someone somewhere would find a use for them. After all, that’s what technologists do, right? The World Wide Web wasn’t designed for publishing the news—it was designed as a neutral platform that could support anything from scientific publications to pornography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics doesn’t work like that. Perhaps at some point putting things on the front page of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; guaranteed that they would be fixed, but that day is long past. The pipeline of leak to investigation to revelation to report to reform has broken down. Technologists can’t depend on journalists to use their stuff; journalists can’t depend on political activists to fix the problems they uncover. Change doesn’t come from thousands of people, all going their separate ways. Change requires bringing people together to work on a common goal. That’s hard for technologists to do by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if they do take that as their goal, they can apply all their talent and ingenuity to the problem. They can measure their success by the number of lives that have been improved by the changes they fought for, rather than the number of people who have visited their website. They can learn which technologies actually make a difference and which ones are merely indulgences. And they can iterate, improve, and scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“The Enemies of the Freedom to Connect Have Not Yet Disappeared”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron’s deftness at collaborating with others to effect change became obvious to a lot of us through his work in the campaign to defeat &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/coica-internet-censorship-and-copyright-bill&quot;&gt;SOPA&lt;/a&gt;, a bill promoted by Hollywood that would have created a “blacklist” of censored websites. &lt;i&gt;The Boy who Could Change the World&lt;/i&gt; features a transcript of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgh2dFngFsg&quot;&gt;Aaron’s now-famous talk&lt;/a&gt;, where he explains how he, EFF, and other Internet activists took a bill that was almost universally supported in Congress and turned it into a bill that no lawmaker wanted to touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it will happen again. Sure, it will have yet another name, and maybe a different excuse, and probably do its damage in a different way. But make no mistake: The enemies of the freedom to connect have not disappeared. The fire in those politicians’ eyes hasn’t been put out. There are a lot of people, a lot of powerful people, who want to clamp down the Internet. And to be honest, there aren’t a whole lot who have a vested interest in protecting it from all of that. Even some of the biggest companies, some of the biggest Internet companies, to put it frankly, would benefit from a world in which their little competitors could get censored. We can’t let that happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aaron’s Legacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A work like this can only ever be a picture of a life incomplete,” Lawrence Lessig laments in his introduction to the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few of us will ever come close to the influence this boy had. He was never on &lt;i&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;NBC Nightly News&lt;/i&gt; never once covered the thoughts of Aaron Swartz. Yet his influence weaved itself through the lives of an incredible number of very different souls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years after his death, it can still be difficult to articulate Aaron’s legacy. He worked on so many technologies that we use every day. He inspired so many people to fight for free software, free culture, open government, and more. But the fights he fought haven’t been won yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the age of 19, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/legacy&quot;&gt;Aaron wrote about what he saw as his own legacy&lt;/a&gt;. He tells the story of an academic who’d encouraged him to get into a certain field because it was “hot.” “Presumably Darwin and Newton didn’t begin their investigations because they thought the field was ‘hot,’” Aaron laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he says, the way to leave a real legacy isn’t by following what’s popular, but by forging new paths that people haven’t thought of yet. “Naturally, doing things like changing the university are much harder than simply becoming yet another professor. But for those who genuinely care about their legacies, it doesn’t seem like there’s much choice.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s Policy Reboot: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/twitters-policy-reboot-good-bad-and-ugly</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;January 12, 2016 Update: It is important to note that some of the language that was added to the Twitter Rules on December 30, 2015 is not entirely new and was recycled from other Twitter Help pages, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.twitter.com/articles/20169997?lang=en&quot;&gt;Abusive behavior policy&lt;/a&gt; page. We consider the direct and explicit inclusion of this language in the Twitter Rules significant for the reasons discussed in the post below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter has struggled with how to deal with harassment and abuse on its service for years. Former CEO Dick Costolo went so far as to say, “We suck at dealing with abuse” and vowed to make improvements. Some of Twitter’s previous efforts in managing online harassment and abuse, particularly those that give users more control over what they see, have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/twitter-gives-users-new-tool-fight-harassment&quot;&gt;garnered our praise&lt;/a&gt; in the past. Allowing users to export and share block lists, for instance, marked an important step in that direction. However, Twitter’s latest announcement gives us some reason for concern. Last Wednesday, Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it is updating their rules to clarify what it considers to be “abusive behavior and hateful conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The updated language emphasizes that Twitter will not tolerate behavior intended to harass, intimidate, or use fear to silence another user’s voice. As always, we embrace and encourage diverse opinions and beliefs – but we will continue to take action on accounts that cross the line into abuse.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A side-by-side comparison of the Twitter Rules on December 27, 2015 and today shows considerable changes. Some of these changes are organizational, such as dividing the sweeping “Abuse and spam” section into respective “Abuse” and “Spam” categories, each with developed subsections. Other changes, however, are substantive and present users with new areas of ambiguity. Notably, four new subsections were added: (1) violent threats, (2) harassment, (3) hateful conduct, and (4) self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was once the “abusive behavior” section is now divided up into one section on harassment and another on hateful conduct. The change is welcome – Twitter did not previously offer guidance as to what constitutes harassment. Today, Twitter lists four factors that the company may consider when evaluating abusive behavior in its harassment section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter also says that it is taking new measures to help people who appear to be contemplating suicide or self-harm while using the platform. In the “Self-Harm” subsection, Twitter indicates that when it receives reports that a user is considering suicide or self-harm, it may “take a number of steps to assist them, such as reaching out to that person expressing our concern and the concern of other users on Twitter or providing resources such as contact information for our mental health partners.” It’s good to see Twitter helping vulnerable users get help, but troubling that the subsection is listed under a header lumping all other offenses: “Any accounts and related accounts engaging in the activities specified below may be temporarily locked and/or subject to permanent suspension.” We hope that Twitter does not suspend users who appear to be contemplating self-harm and/or suicide, and reaches out to them instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/2015/holding-public-officials-accountable-with-twitter-and-politwoops&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will put free speech ahead of the “rights” of politicians to avoid embarrassment. Last summer, Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/twitter-axes-accountability-projects-sparing-politicians-embarrassment&quot;&gt;pulled the plug&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://politwoops.sunlightfoundation.com/&quot;&gt;Politwoops&lt;/a&gt;, a transparency project that records, stores, and publishes deleted tweets of politicians, by revoking access to its API. Last Thursday, Twitter announced that it reached an agreement with the Open State Foundation, the group that runs the project. Politwoops will again be functional – and it’s refreshing to see Twitter correct a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subsection on violent threats now includes a short clause on “threatening or promoting terrorism.” The clause is likely to have been added as a response to critics who claim Twitter is not doing enough to silence Daesh recruiters on its service. Seemingly short and concise, the clause is worryingly vague. Our own Supreme Court has struggled with defining the word “terrorism,” and Twitter does not offer a working definition either. Further, Twitter has not given us any information on what it considers speech that is “promoting terrorism,” or when free speech crosses the line and becomes offending content on the basis of promoting terrorism. This presents Twitter the massive responsibility of defining terrorism and justifying account suspensions accordingly. The lack of transparency in what is considered the promotion of terrorism risks Twitter applying its new policy to users inconsistently and arbitrarily, and ultimately, suppressing free speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, whereas the rules previously only banned “violence against others,” they now explicitly ban hateful speech – defined as any speech that threatens other people “on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease” or incites harm towards others on the same bases. Threatening speech can cause harm, but we remain uncomfortable with the prospect of leaving it to Twitter to distinguish hateful speech from speaking truth to power across hundreds of countries and across every community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Twitter removes user-generated content in a non-transparent way that leaves no room for accountability, which makes it impossible to know whether Twitter’s policies are being applied fairly across the board. In an effort to shed light on this problem, which plagues all social media platforms, EFF has partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;http://visualizingimpact.org/&quot;&gt;Visualizing Impact&lt;/a&gt; to launch &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinecensorship.org/&quot;&gt;Onlinecensorship.org&lt;/a&gt; – a platform that documents the who, what, and why of content takedowns on social media. Onlinecensorship.org also provides other tools for users, including a guide to various appeals processes to fight content takedowns on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as long as the content take-down process remains unaccountable and opaque, we will remain uncomfortable with large scale social media platforms determining for all their users what constitutes unacceptable speech and taking it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if to prove that our worries regarding overreach are well founded, Twitter’s new policies may have already resulted in an embarrassing mix-up. On December 31, the company suspended the account of Norway-based human rights activist Iyad Al-Baghdadi shortly after two news articles misidentified him as Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, the leader of Daesh – “Al-Baghdadi” is a very common name in the Arab world. Twitter simply sent Al-Baghdadi a message telling him that he has “violated the Twitter Rules.” Iyad al-Baghdadi is a prominent activist that has a large following online and no connection whatsoever to Daesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without transparency, these procedures also leave undisclosed the extent to which these companies might be pressured to censor and suspend at the request of the U.S. government. With news that the White House has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-tech-idUSKBN0UL2H320160107&quot;&gt;holding&lt;/a&gt; private meetings with Twitter and other companies to discuss how they might combat terrorism, that concern can only grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter’s purported intention with the latest rule changes is to clarify what “abusive behavior” entails for the purposes of using the service. In reality, the changes do little but further confound the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:10px&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Share this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Twitter%E2%80%99s%20Policy%20Reboot%3A%20the%20Good%2C%20the%20Bad%2C%20and%20the%20Ugly&amp;amp;url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/twitters-policy-reboot-good-bad-and-ugly&amp;amp;related=eff&amp;amp;via=eff&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/twitter48.png&quot; alt=&quot;Share on Twitter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/share.php?t=Twitter%E2%80%99s%20Policy%20Reboot%3A%20the%20Good%2C%20the%20Bad%2C%20and%20the%20Ugly&amp;amp;u=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/twitters-policy-reboot-good-bad-and-ugly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/facebook48.png&quot; alt=&quot;Share on Facebook&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/twitters-policy-reboot-good-bad-and-ugly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/gplus48.png&quot; alt=&quot;Share on Google+&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sharetodiaspora.github.com/?title=Twitter%E2%80%99s%20Policy%20Reboot%3A%20the%20Good%2C%20the%20Bad%2C%20and%20the%20Ugly&amp;amp;url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/twitters-policy-reboot-good-bad-and-ugly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/diaspora48.png&quot; alt=&quot;Share on Diaspora&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://supporters.eff.org/join&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#cc0000; color:#ffffff; text-decoration:none; cursor:pointer; padding:5px 8px; font-family:verdana; font-weight:bold; border-radius:8px; text-shadow: 1px 1px #660000; text-transform:uppercase;&quot;&gt;Join EFF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Your Apps, Please? China Shows how Surveillance Leads to Intimidation and Software Censorship</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/china-shows-how-backdoors-lead-software-censorship</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xinjiang, home of the China&#039;s muslim Uighur minority, has &lt;a href=&quot;http://thediplomat.com/2014/07/how-china-dismantled-the-uyghur-internet/&quot;&gt;long been the world&#039;s laboratory&lt;/a&gt; for Internet repression. Faced with widespread local unrest, and online debate, China has done everything it can to enforce its vision of the Net in the region, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://uhrp.org/press-release/trapped-virtual-cage-chinese-state-repression-uyghurs-online.html&quot;&gt;imprisoning bloggers and online publishers&lt;/a&gt;, to quarantining the entire Xinjiang network from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21574633-turning-entire-internet-nuclear-option-best-not-exercised-thou-shalt-not-kill&quot;&gt;the rest of the Internet&lt;/a&gt; for over ten months in 2009. Nonetheless, Xinjiang residents still circumvent censorship and surveillance in the pursuit of privacy and free expression. They use virtual private networks and other methods to get around the Great Firewall. They use popular messaging apps that they have heard could defend them against surveillance, like WhatsApp and Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now China has taken the next step. In November, a select group of Xinjiang residents found their mobile phone service &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/24/business/international/china-cuts-mobile-service-of-xinjiang-residents-evading-internet-filters.html&quot;&gt;abruptly terminated&lt;/a&gt;. Their phone service providers told them to visit their local police station to have the service restored. When contacted, the police told them that they had been detected using a VPN, or downloading foreign messaging software. Remove the software, the police said, and you&#039;ll get your connection back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with being unable to spy on every conversation, China has set upon outlawing not just the content of particular communications, but the use of particular general purpose applications. Censorship has expanded from certain speech acts, to any software that enables free speech. In Xinjiang, there are no innocent users of certain programs, because that software is itself a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not be just Xinjiang where ordinary users are being punished for their use of particular software. Last year, EFF spoke to a Chinese Internet user from outside Xinjiang who had a similar experience. They too were contacted by the authorities shortly after using a VPN for the first time on their family&#039;s broadband connection. A telephone call, from an unknown source, called and instructed them to stop using the software. It was unclear whether the call was from the local Internet provider, or one of China&#039;s multiple Internet security services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Xinjiang, China has now started using other elements of state control to police software use. At road checkpoints, the New York Times&#039; outgoing China correspondent Andew Jacobs noted, ethnic Uighurs are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/world/asia/xinjiang-seethes-under-chinese-crackdown.html&quot;&gt;asked to hand over their cellphones&lt;/a&gt;. There, local police have indicated that apps like Skype and WhatsApp are indicators of subversive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve understood for a long time that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/02/censorship-inseperable-from-surveillance&quot;&gt;Internet censorship requires pervasive surveillance&lt;/a&gt;. A centralized censor needs to know everything that you&#039;re looking at, so that it can block what it does not want you to see. What China&#039;s new strategies demonstrates is that relationship works the other way. Pervasive surveillance requires censorship of software and services. Mandating backdoors or outlawing encryption can&#039;t stop anyone from using secure tools or working encryption. So to achieve that policy goal, governments will also need to censor the kinds of software computer users can download or execute. Backdoors lead to checkpoints and software censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are we going to allow a means of communication which it simply isn&#039;t possible to read?&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet-security/11340621/Spies-should-be-able-to-monitor-all-online-messaging-says-David-Cameron.html&quot;&gt;asked David Cameron&lt;/a&gt; a year ago. He answered his own question, &quot;No we must not.&quot; But has he, and have the other policymakers considering a backdoor policy, considered all the consequences? Are they all intent on walking blindly into Xinjiang?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Friends, Please Tell T-Mobile’s CEO About EFF</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/friends-please-tell-t-mobiles-ceo-about-eff</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a colorful selfie video released today, John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile, got riled up and demanded to know who EFF is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came in response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/binge-lite-ask-truth-about-t-mobile-video-throttling&quot;&gt;questions that EFF submitted during Legere’s Twitter Q&amp;amp;A session&lt;/a&gt; about the new T-Mobile service, Binge On. Earlier this week, EFF published a report showing how the service—which T-Mobile claimed used adaptive video technology to optimize streaming for mobile devices—actually just throttled video and left the optimization to the video providers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/eff-confirms-t-mobiles-bingeon-optimization-just-throttling-applies&quot;&gt;Check out our detailed report.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are lots of unanswered questions about Binge On, which is why EFF and our followers were happy to engage with Mr. Legere during today’s Twitter conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legere, it seems, was less happy to engage with us. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/685201130427531264&quot;&gt;demanded&lt;/a&gt; to know: “Who the f*ck are you anyway EFF, why are you stirring up so much trouble, and who pays you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, EFF members, friends, and technology users worldwide have stepped up to answer that question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2016/01/07/legere-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;664&quot; width=&quot;457&quot; /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think the best response comes from the community of people who support our work. As a member-funded organization, EFF exists because of the donations of tens of thousands of regular people. And as an advocacy organization fighting for civil liberties in the digital world, we are able to influence powerful entities—from heads of state to elected officials to tech giants—because so many people stand with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider yourself part of the EFF community? Care about the future of digital rights online? Then please send a tweet to Mr. John Legere and introduce yourself using the hashtag #WeAreEFF. Want to support our work? &lt;a href=&quot;https://supporters.eff.org/donate/button&quot;&gt;Join here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Note to Congress: The NSA Seizes More than Just Your Conversations with Israeli Leaders</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/note-congress-nsa-seizes-more-just-your-conversations-israeli-leaders</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the holiday break, Congress was up in arms over a &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-spy-net-on-israel-snares-congress-1451425210&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; revealing lawmakers&#039; private conversations with Israeli officials and interest groups were swept up by the National Security Agency during the US-Iran nuclear negotiations. But these aren&#039;t the only congressional communications collected by the NSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How vast is the dragnet? On what other national policy matters has NSA surveillance impacted Members of Congress? A congressional investigation remains long overdue, but these revelations should prompt Congress to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/former-church-committee-staffers-tell-congress-reassert-authority-40th-anniversary&quot;&gt;Church Committee for the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Were the Communications Collected?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communications were partly collected by the ubiquitous surveillance authorized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/702-one-pager-adv&quot;&gt;Section 702&lt;/a&gt; of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/primer-executive-order-12333-mass-surveillance-starlet&quot;&gt;Executive Order 12333&lt;/a&gt;. The authorities don&#039;t just collect the communications of a specific suspect or target like with a FISA or probable cause warrant. Section 702 and EO 12333 collect communications about broad swaths of topics and categories—even the entire set of communications exiting a city or entire &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/&quot;&gt;country&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, even communications between two Americans routed abroad (a not uncommon occurrence given the structure of the Internet) may also be collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innocent American (including Congressional) communications will be collected even if the NSA is targeting legitimate foreign intelligence targets. That&#039;s a huge—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying&quot;&gt;Constitutional&lt;/a&gt;—problem. After conducting a sample of Section 702-collected communications a federal judge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/way-nsa-uses-section-702-deeply-troubling-heres-why&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that millions of innocent Americans&#039; communications ended up in NSA databases. It shouldn&#039;t surprise anyone that many communications&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;between a lawmaker or their staff and foreign leaders (or their staff) might be collected by the NSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If lawmakers are surprised about the communications uncovered by the Wall Street Journal, they may also be surprised to learn that discussions with entities like the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations are also probably collected. Even discussions about foreign trade topics with foreign partners may also be in NSA databases. That&#039;s because these broad categories and topics are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/secret-nsa-documents-show-how-the-us-spies-on-europe-and-the-un-a-918625-2.html&quot;&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/secret-nsa-documents-show-how-the-us-spies-on-europe-and-the-un-a-918625-2.html&quot;&gt;priorities&lt;/a&gt; in the classified version of the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF)—a document where the President prioritizes what countries and topics the intelligence community should report on. Priorities don&#039;t only include Chinese, Iranian, or North Korean leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congress Must Demand (Public) Answers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitous collection is a fact of the NSA&#039;s surveillance regime. The NSA&#039;s surveillance methods have been causing near-monthly controversy since 2013 over the collection of innocent users&#039; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-broke-privacy-rules-thousands-of-times-per-year-audit-finds/2013/08/15/3310e554-05ca-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html&quot;&gt;phone calls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/27/nsa-data-mining-authorised-obama&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-collects-millions-of-e-mail-address-books-globally/2013/10/14/8e58b5be-34f9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html?&quot;&gt;address books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-collects-millions-of-e-mail-address-books-globally/2013/10/14/8e58b5be-34f9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html?&quot;&gt;buddy lists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-collects-millions-of-e-mail-address-books-globally/2013/10/14/8e58b5be-34f9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost&quot;&gt;calling records&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.propublica.org/article/world-of-spycraft-intelligence-agencies-spied-in-online-games&quot;&gt;online video game chats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303559504579198370113163530&quot;&gt;financial documents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/10/nsa-uses-google-cookies-to-pinpoint-targets-for-hacking/&quot;&gt;browsing history&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/16/nsa-collects-millions-text-messages-daily-untargeted-global-sweep&quot;&gt;text messages&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html&quot;&gt;calendar data&lt;/a&gt;. The newest controversy dealing with Israeli communications should prompt Congress to ask serious questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House Intelligence Committee and Oversight Committee is &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160103043928/http://intelligence.house.gov/press-release/nunes-comments-intelligence-collection-allegations&quot;&gt;looking into NSA data collection&lt;/a&gt;, but lawmakers should also be asking their own questions and demanding their own briefings. Why wasn&#039;t the Intelligence Committee notified of the collection of Congressional communications? Other key questions lawmakers may want to ask include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Approximately how many communications or transactions involving Senators, Representatives, or their staff were subject to Section 702 or EO 12333 surveillance&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;on a yearly basis? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many times, if any, were lawmakers notified when their name was included in a communication or revealed to the Executive branch in summaries of intercepted communications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many times, if any, were lawmakers information minimized by the NSA and disseminated (whether to the Executive branch, international partners, etc.) outside of the NSA?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many communications seized or shared involve policymakers&#039; communications with constituents, or other Americans or organizations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the exact policies and guidelines for when the intelligence community can collect communications by lawmakers or their aides, and what happens to that information after it is collected?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to recent concerns, NSA officials will likely tell Congress that Americans&#039; information is &quot;minimized&quot;—a fancy legal term for blacking out, or &quot;masking,&quot; a name. But at any time the NSA can undo the deletion if someone decides that doing so is necessary to understand &lt;i&gt;anything related to foreign intelligence&lt;/i&gt;, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801&quot;&gt;broadly defined&lt;/a&gt; in law&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor is the NSA the only agency implicated. The FBI can search for an American name in databases even without any probable cause to review your communications, which is commonly referred to as the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/nsa-loophole-warrantless-searches-email-calls&quot;&gt;702 backdoor search&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/us/politics/letter-puts-focus-on-us-searches-for-americans-emails-and-calls.html&quot;&gt;loophole&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NSA may also tell policymakers that communications between members and foreign targets are destroyed upon interception, but this doesn&#039;t include staffers and doesn&#039;t appear to be a rule in any of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Minimization%20Procedures%20used%20by%20NSA%20in%20Connection%20with%20FISA%20SECT%20702.pdf&quot;&gt;publicly released&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/January%2025,%202011%20United%20States%20Signals%20Intelligence%20Directive%2018.pdf&quot;&gt;minimization policies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These non-answers and deflections ultimately reveal what many lawmakers already know: the Intelligence Committees are not acting as diligent overseers. Many lawmakers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/former-church-committee-staffers-tell-congress-reassert-authority-40th-anniversary&quot;&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/03/ex-church-committee-staffers-call-congress-create-modern-day-church-committee&quot;&gt;skeptical&lt;/a&gt; about the modern Intelligence Committees’ ability to properly investigate Intelligence agencies and their practices. Such skepticism must be addressed immediately as one of the government’s main surveillance authorities is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act_of_1978_Amendments_Act_of_2008&quot;&gt;scheduled to expire at the end of 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress must &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/03/ex-church-committee-staffers-call-congress-create-modern-day-church-committee&quot;&gt;heed&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/web-stories/panelists-discuss-surveillance.cfm&quot;&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; of lawmakers like Vice President Walter Mondale, John McCain, and over a dozen former &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee&quot;&gt;Church Committee&lt;/a&gt; staffers—including its Former Chief Counsel Fritz Schwarz—to create a separate Congressional investigation into the signals intelligence programs revealed by Edward Snowden. Only after establishing meaningful transparency can the real work on substantive reform finally begin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These latest revelations of spying on the people’s representatives in Congress expose how little policymakers still know about mass surveillance, and how many questions they have yet to ask. Congress must take this opportunity to delve deeply into the Executive Branch&#039;s surveillance in order provide a full accounting to the public, to our allies, and to its own Members.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Binge On Lite? Ask for the Truth about T-Mobile Video Throttling</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/binge-lite-ask-truth-about-t-mobile-video-throttling</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;At Noon Today, Demand Real Answers from John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;T-Mobile&#039;s Binge On service could have been great. Giving customers a choice about how to use their data so that they can stream more video without hitting their data cap is a wonderful idea. Unfortunately, T-Mobile botched the roll out. Without asking, they made it the default for all of their customers. In other words, they decided to throttle all video—not just zero-rated video. And they claimed to be using “video optimization technology throughout [their] network” even though their network doesn’t actually alter video content in any way. EFF uncovered these facts and more through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/eff-confirms-t-mobiles-bingeon-optimization-just-throttling-applies&quot;&gt;testing earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, and our research ignited a backlash across T-Mobile’s Netflix-loving community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Now, T-Mobile is on the defensive.  John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile, is hosting a Q&amp;amp;A on Twitter today, &lt;strong&gt;starting at noon Pacific time&lt;/strong&gt;, in an attempt to quell concerns. That means concerned members of the digital public have an opportunity to discuss the issues directly with Mr. Legere. Just use the hastag #AskJohn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’ve drafted a few questions, but it’s far better if you come up with your own questions, in your own words. It’s vital that T-Mobile understands that their technology choices affects the lives of millions, and those millions are willing to speak out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Some questions you might want to ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=webclient&amp;amp;text=.%40JohnLegere+The+%40EFF+research+found+that+Binge+On+throttles+videos.+Will+you+ensure+that+Binge+On+does+not+downgrade+all+my+video%3F+%23AskJohn&quot; title=&quot;The @EFF research found that Binge On throttles videos. Will you ensure that Binge On does not downgrade all my video? #AskJohn&quot;&gt;The @EFF research found that Binge On throttles video. Will you ensure that Binge On doesn’t downgrade all my video? #AskJohn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=webclient&amp;amp;text=.%40JohnLegere+How+exactly+does+%40TMobile%27s+%22adaptive+video+tech%22+work%3F+Does+it+alter+content+of+video+streams+in+TMo%27s+network%3F+%23AskJohn&quot;&gt;How exactly does TMo&#039;s &quot;adaptive video tech&quot; work? Does it actually alter content of video streams in TMo&#039;s network? #AskJohn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=webclient&amp;amp;text=.%40JohnLegere+Why+was+Binge+On+enabled+for+unlimited+customers+who+don&#039;t+need+to+worry+about+%22stretching+their+data%22%3F+%23AskJohn&quot;&gt;Why was Binge On enabled for unlimited customers who don&#039;t need to worry about &quot;stretching their data?&quot; #AskJohn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=webclient&amp;amp;text=.%40JohnLegere+Why+not+make+Binge+On+opt-in,+instead+of+opt-out%3F+%23AskJohn&quot;&gt;Why not make Binge On opt-in, instead of opt-out? #AskJohn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=webclient&amp;amp;text=.%40JohnLegere+Does+Binge+On+zero-rate+all+video+it+throttles/%22optimizes%22+(including+non-enrolled+providers)%3F+%23AskJohn&quot;&gt;Does Binge On zero-rate all video it throttles/&quot;optimizes&quot; (including non-enrolled providers)? If not, why not? #AskJohn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;T-Mobile seems to be arguing that downgrading video quality is not actually throttling, but we disagree. &quot;Throttling&quot; means that when a video stream hits T-Mobile&#039;s network, its bandwidth is capped. If the video provider&#039;s server has the capability to adapt the quality of the video, then the server can do that—but it is the video provider that is using &quot;adaptive video technology,&quot; not T-Mobile. In other words, T-Mobile just constrains the bandwidth, and it&#039;s up to video providers to make sure their videos stream smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This isn&#039;t semantics—it&#039;s apples and oranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If T-Mobile wanted to give its customers more choice, it would have made Binge On opt-in, not opt-out. And if Binge On was really about helping customers stretch their data, then T-Mobile wouldn’t have automatically enabled Binge On for customers with &lt;em&gt;unlimited&lt;/em&gt; data. They would also zero-rate all videos they throttle, not just the videos of providers who have enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The fact is, T-Mobile isn&#039;t being honest with its customers. We agree with John Legere: it’s time to set the record straight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More Needs to be Done to Strengthen Protection of Human Subjects in Scientific Experiments</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/more-needs-be-done-strengthen-protection-human-subjects-scientific-experiments</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has proposed a sweeping update to the federal regulations that govern scientific experiments involving human subjects, whether it’s studying behavior, testing biological specimens, or analyzing DNA. While the proposed policy [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-09-08/pdf/2015-21756.pdf&quot;&gt;.pdf&lt;/a&gt;] generally moves in the right direction, EFF has filed formal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/eff-comments-proposed-rulemaking-human-subjects-research-protections&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; outlining several serious concerns about how these rules will impact privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/commonrule/&quot;&gt;Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects&lt;/a&gt;”—often referred to as the “Common Rule”—is the ethical framework for biomedical and behavioral research established in the wake of medical scandals that shook the nation, including the now infamous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm&quot;&gt;Tuskegee Syphilis Study&lt;/a&gt;, in which the U.S. government withheld treatment and medical information from rural African-American men suffering from the disease. Much of the Common Rule revolves around two concepts: informed consent and independent review. These principles reflect the need for people need to know the risks and benefits and what will happen to their specimens before agreeing to participate in an experiment and the idea that researchers will make better ethical decisions with the guidance of oversight bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Common Rule is up for its first full update since it was published in 1991. In reviewing the policy, HHS is not only supposed to address ethical issues that have arisen over the last two decades but also to take a forward-looking approach to protect human subjects from potential abuses that may emerge in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most controversial elements in the proposed regulations is how researchers conduct secondary experiments on biospecimens. Under the current rule, researchers do not require informed consent for secondary research performed on “non-identified” biospecimens. In lay terms, researchers don’t need your permission to run tests on specimens taken for other reasons, such as the leftover blood or tissue from a routine doctor’s visit, as long as the specimens can’t be linked to you. However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techinsider.io/proposed-common-rule-changes-go-unnoticed-2016-1&quot;&gt;as TechInsider explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that &quot;stripped of your personal information&quot; bit is tricky—and easily bungled. Researchers have shown that today, they can use genetic testing and information on the internet, for example, to re-identify samples that were supposed to be anonymous. Nobody imagined that could happen back in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While HHS’s proposal makes progress on this issue, EFF thinks it should go further. Unfortunately, this is far from the only controversial aspect of the Common Rule update. The proposal also includes numerous loopholes and exemptions that we believe are unnecessary and potentially dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are among the issues EFF raises in our comments, authored by EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien and EFF Legal Intern Yonatan Moskowitz:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HIPAA Exception &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed rule would exempt research covered under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We believe this exception should be removed or narrowed significantly, because it mistakenly assumes that the existing legal statutory regime is up to date ethically and constitutionally. As we write in the comments: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Common Rule cannot merely assume that existing law adequately considers the modern importance of respecting patients’ autonomy and privacy. An inherent weakness of HIPAA is that its Privacy and Security Rule only applies to “covered entities” and their business associates. When treatment providers and other entities subject to HIPAA disclose data to, for example, state government entities for public health purposes, such data is no longer protected by HIPAA unless the government entity is already subject to HIPAA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consent in the Age of Big Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disagree with HHS’s assertion that it may not be as important to require informed consent in research that involves algorithmic analysis of “big data.” Instead, we argue, that while “big data” does make research easier, these technological advancement can also enhance the rights of human subjects. HHS also should be wary that “big data” can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/reports/big-data-tool-inclusion-or-exclusion-understanding-issues-ftc-report&quot;&gt;reproduce and exacerbate&lt;/a&gt; existing inequalities and injustices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, computational and data-storage advances have increased the ease with which researchers can receive, track, send, and enforce fine-grained consent on the same databases they will be manipulating to perform their research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, this ease of data transfer has had a paradigm-shifting impact on the ability of entities to aggregate deep databases on individuals—the disclosure of which have much more of an impact on patient privacy than the disclosure of databases did in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Broad vs. Granular Consent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the proposed rule would require informed consent for secondary research on “non-identified” biospecimens, the type of consent HHS envisions is not enough to protect subjects: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the updated Rule would implement this requirement via a broad consent for future research, under which any such research would be “exempt” research that would not require annual continuing review by an IRB. We seriously question this approach. First, broad consent to future research is arguably the least meaningful form of individual consent. The human subject will not know what the future biospecimen research entails, how it will affect him or her, how the biospecimen or research data will be shared, or which biospecimens they can expect to provide in the time period that this consent is presumed valid for.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, while genomic-related research and technology is of great potential benefit, its rapid evolution also presents significant risk and uncertainty to privacy and social control, especially given the increasing use by law enforcement and government of genetic identification. And quite apart from the concerns about government access, use or disclosure of genetic data raises ethical and privacy issues for individuals in the employment and other private-sector contexts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed rule is based on the assumption that “individual tracking” of test subjects is too much of a burden for researchers. We obviously disagree; individual tracking can be easily accomplished with modern technology, such as APIs. As we explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if the specimens may only be used if the researcher reports which specimens they are using and which information they intend to extract, then the researcher can query the database for fields that record a more fine-grained consent for secondary research. An individual could therefore offer consent for only certain kinds of experiments, and could require that information to be received by researchers before they undertake any experiments. And before a person undertakes research on the specimen, they could be required to confirm that their study fits into the permission granted from the human subject, and to check with the original specimen-collecting researcher to confirm that the cumulative information gathered from the tests will not surpass the human subject’s individual de-anonymization threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Self-Regulation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re concerned that proposal allows heads of department or agencies conducting the research to make the final decision whether the research is covered by the Common Rule. We believe HHS should consider including a sanction or private cause of action when researchers or department heads erroneously grant exemptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our primary concern here is to preserve meaningful oversight, which we believe requires after-the-fact accountability. The NPRM must lay out a more substantive process mandating more than one level of appeal/review by a human in all but the most clear-cut examples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also warned HHS of the dangers of research institutions allow researchers to make their own determinations or use an automated tool to determine whether their research is exempt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intelligence Activity Exemption &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal includes exemptions for intelligence surveillance activities. Since the intelligence communities have long histories of using creative interpretations of the law and regulations, we believe that any exemption should be subjected to heightened review. As we write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[The policy] offers practically no limitation to an intelligence community with a history of expansively interpreting limited exemptions. There should be a discussion, a representative list, or at a minimum a modifier added here to give future courts or administrative law judges some sort of applicable standards to apply if a dispute arises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Public Behavior Exemption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed rule would also exempt studies of public behavior from independent review if the information is properly anonymized. However, the rule fails to define what behavior is public or to explain what behavior is public enough that it shouldn’t be protected. As we write, this exception could allow for inappropriate research into Internet browsing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, information disclosed to Internet Service Providers including requests for pages and documents to be sent to a particular IP address should not be considered public merely because they are not occurring in a single physical place in one person’s home. This is true even if tools can be developed to observe this—and only this—information from a “public” place that the information happens to pass through on its way to a destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s Next &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These items are only a selection of our concerns. However, as critical as we are of the proposed regulation, there’s serious risk that it could get even worse. Biotech and pharmaceutical companies and well-funded research institutions have come out hard against the policies in the other direction, since they would prefer to conduct experiments with as little oversight and restriction as possible. We’ll be watching closely for developments, including further opportunities to lodge feedback and opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/dhs-issues-guidance-state-and-local-drones</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2016/01/07/fpg-dhs-drones.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;265&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before the holidays, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) working group released guidance for state and local agencies using drone aircraft. The document, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/UAS%20Best%20Practices.pdf&quot;&gt;Best Practices for Protecting Privacy, Civil Rights &amp;amp; Civil Liberti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/UAS%20Best%20Practices.pdf&quot;&gt;es&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/UAS%20Best%20Practices.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt; In Unmanned Aircraft Systems Programs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, addresses concerns over the implications of high-tech tools that, without rigorous controls and oversight embedded in law and embodied in code, can easily be abused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Process and substance to prevent predictable abuses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some aspects of the guidance construct a robust process surrounding the adoption of drones. For instance, it suggests consultation with legal counsel and issue experts, as well as a clear definition of a program’s mission and scope. The guidance also recommends ongoing assessment of privacy impacts and a redress program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other more substantive provisions address the use of drones themselves. For instance, the DHS guidance suggests limits on how drones collect data, how the data used, how long it is retained, and to whom and for what purposes it is disseminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, the working group even calls for accountability when data from drones is used improperly and addresses two contexts in which that has unfortunately recurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the working group recommended policies to prevent overzealous authorities from undermining the constitutional speech and assembly rights at the core of our democratic political process. It suggests that agencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be attuned to the potential privacy risks…arising from inadvertently capturing images of individuals engaging in constitutionally protected activities, and establish appropriate guidelines and administrative controls to anonymize, destroy, safeguard or prevent the misuse of such data….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, responding to long-standing patterns of unconstitutional ethnic profiling by police agencies, the guidance reminds policymakers and agencies that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collection, use, dissemination, or retention of unmanned aircraft system-recorded data should not be based solely on individual characteristics (e.g., race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, or gender)….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see such broad recommendations &lt;span&gt;addressing needs from transparency to civil liberties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; coming from a government agency is an encouraging sign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Insufficiencies and ironies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the guidance also leaves much to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, despite nodding to concerns about ethnic profiling, the guidance ultimately fails to address them. DHS suggests that drones not be used to collect data based &lt;i&gt;solely&lt;/i&gt; on demographic indicia. It does, however, allow profiling based on a combination of factors, which lends itself to profiling particularly when no specific suspect description connects the target of an investigation to a discrete incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At root, the guidance remains advisory, binding neither state nor local agencies, nor even agencies within DHS itself. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2014/0205/Drones-on-the-US-border-Are-they-worth-the-price&quot;&gt;Longstanding concerns&lt;/a&gt; about inadequate transparency and protections by DHS component agencies will remain and continue to mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance is also limited to particular settings. The working group said its guidance was “intended for first responders (e.g., emergency management, emergency medical service, fire departments, and security professionals responding  to disasters and other emergencies) and does not seek to provide guidance in regard to investigative use of [drones],” despite the group’s recognition of historical patterns of recurring abuses by law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By declining to address investigative uses of drones, the guidance sidesteps an elephant in the room: the constitutional requirement for a judicial warrant. Several states as politically diverse as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3520&amp;amp;ChapterID=54&quot;&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/17854-utah-legislature-sends-drone-surveillance-nullifying-bill-to-governor&quot;&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; have legislatively reiterated the warrant requirement for drones even for law enforcement purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might hope that only thoughtful and conscientious professionals could get their hands on powerful tools by working for a public agency. Our Founders expected otherwise and created the warrant requirement to ensure the legitimacy of both criminal and non-criminal investigations by forcing the government to justify them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most timely aspects of the best practices is their recognition of the value of encryption. Despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141019/07115528878/everybody-knows-fbi-director-james-comey-is-wrong-about-encryption-even-fbi.shtml&quot;&gt;self-serving claims by intelligence officials&lt;/a&gt; that encryption represents a threat to national security, DHS’ 2015 guidance on drones explicitly advises local and state authorities to employ encryption to ensure the security of data they collect and retain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By recognizing that encryption enhances security, the DHS guidance could undermine &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/263006-paris-san-bernadino-law-enforcement-and-encryption&quot;&gt;half-baked FBI proposals&lt;/a&gt; to subvert encryption by mandating back doors for intelligence agencies and instead reinforce &lt;a href=&quot;https://savecrypto.org/&quot;&gt;a common sense consensus&lt;/a&gt; uniting the tech community and privacy advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps congressional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151224/22431133172/senator-richard-burr-confused-wrong-encryption.shtml&quot;&gt;policymakers less inclined to heed privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt; will prove more responsive to the security concerns of DHS officials. Regardless, the department’s recent guidance can help inform the debate, especially where local and state policymakers propose legislation to embody its most helpful recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EFF Confirms: T-Mobile’s Binge On Optimization is Just Throttling, Applies Indiscriminately to All Video</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/eff-confirms-t-mobiles-bingeon-optimization-just-throttling-applies</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Back in November, T-Mobile announced a new service for its mobile customers called Binge On, in which video streams from certain websites don’t count against customers’ data caps.&lt;a class=&quot;see-footnote&quot; id=&quot;footnoteref1_zyhw1el&quot; title=&quot;To be fair, T-Mobile’s plans don’t have traditional data caps—they just slow down to “2G” speeds once customers exceed a certain amount of data. With that said, a limit on data is still a limit on data—and we’ll call it a cap for the purposes of this post.&quot; href=&quot;#footnote1_zyhw1el&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; The service is theoretically open to all video providers without charge, so long as T-Mobile can recognize and then “optimize” the provider’s video streams to a bitrate equivalent to 480p. At first glance, this doesn’t sound too harmful—customers can watch more video without worrying about their caps, most will consider 480p to be adequate quality (especially on a small phone screen), and the harms of treating individual video providers differently are diminished when T-Mobile offers the program to any provider for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/12/t_mobile_s_binge_on_program_likely_violates_net_neutrality.html&quot;&gt;as Marvin Ammori wrote in Slate&lt;/a&gt;, there is another “feature” of Binge On that has &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/help/tmobile-throttling-unlimited-data-video-t3256742&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/3ufgtc/youtube_being_throttled/&quot;&gt;customers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/3u1pkw/tmobile_throttling_twitchtv_can_no_longer_stream/&quot;&gt;complaining&lt;/a&gt;. Ammori pointed out that T-Mobile is applying its “optimization” to &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; video, not just the video of providers who have asked T-Mobile to be zero-rated. T-Mobile claims it does this to provide a better experience for its customers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.t-mobile.com/Company/CompanyInfo.aspx?tp=Abt_Tab_ConsumerInfo&amp;amp;tsp=Abt_Sub_InternetServices&quot;&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;“T-Mobile utilizes streaming video optimization technology throughout its network to help customers stretch their high-speed data while streaming video”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;and that Binge On helps “deliver a DVD quality (typically 480p or better) video experience with minimal buffering while streaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Testing T-Mobile’s Binge On Optimization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We were curious what exactly this optimization technology involved, so we decided to test it out for ourselves. We posted a video on one of our servers and tried accessing it via a T-Mobile LTE connection using various methods and under various conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(If you want to skip the technical details of our testing and jump directly to the results, &lt;a href=&quot;#results&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;All of the tests were done with an account that had Binge On enabled, in the same physical location and at roughly the same time of day, using the same phone. We ensured the phone had a good 4G LTE connection at all times. For each test, we measured the throughput between our server and the phone for approximately five minutes at five second intervals. The four tests we performed were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Streaming a video embedded in a webpage using HTML5 (“Streaming in Browser”),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloading a video file to the phone’s SD card (“Direct Download”),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloading a video file to the phone’s SD card, but with the filename and the HTTP response headers changed to indicate it was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a video file (“Direct Download, Non-Video File Extension”), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloading a large non-video file for comparison (“Direct Non-Video Download”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Each test was done over an HTTP connection, which allowed T-Mobile’s network to observe the content of the connection and perform “optimization” (labeled “Binge On” in the graph below), and over an HTTPS connection, which prevented T-Mobile’s network from observing the content of the connection, thus representing behavior without any sort of Binge-On-related optimization (“Normal”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Our findings are summarized in the graph below, where we plot the mean throughput for each test, as well as one standard deviation. The units are megabits per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/styles/large/public/2016/01/03/results_xlsx.png?itok=QAxZ9ivk&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Test Results: No Optimization, and Everything Gets Throttled&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The first result of our test confirms that when Binge On is enabled, T-Mobile throttles &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; HTML5 video streams to around 1.5Mps, even when the phone is capable of downloading at higher speeds, and regardless of whether or not the video provider enrolled in Binge On. This is the case whether the video is being streamed &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; being downloaded—which means that T-Mobile is artificially reducing the download speeds of customers with Binge On enabled, even if they’re downloading the video to watch later. It also means that videos are being throttled even if they’re being watched or downloaded to another device via a tethered connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The second major finding in our tests is that T-Mobile is throttling video downloads even when the filename and HTTP headers (specifically the Content-Type) indicate the file is not a video file. We asked T-Mobile if this means they are looking deeper than TCP and HTTP headers, and identifying video streams by inspecting the content of their customers’ communications, and they told us that they have solutions to detect video-specific protocols/patterns that do not involve the examination of actual content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Our last finding is that T-Mobile’s video “optimization” doesn’t actually alter or enhance the video stream for delivery to a mobile device over a mobile network in any way. &lt;a class=&quot;see-footnote&quot; id=&quot;footnoteref2_l8twp62&quot; title=&quot;We determined this by comparing the hash of a downloaded video file to the hash of the same file on the server; in all of our tests, the hash was identical.&quot; href=&quot;#footnote2_l8twp62&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; This means T-Mobile’s “optimization” consists entirely of throttling the video stream’s throughput down to 1.5Mbps. If the video is more than 480p and the server sending the video doesn’t have a way to reduce or adapt the bitrate of the video as it’s being streamed, the result is stuttering and uneven streaming—exactly the opposite of the experience T-Mobile claims their “optimization” will have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Given the difference between what T-Mobile implies they do and what we found, we contacted them to get clarification. They confirmed that they don’t do any actual optimization of video streams other than reducing the bandwidth allocated to them (and relying on the provider to notice, and adapt the bitrate accordingly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/TMobile-Were-Not-Throttling-YouTube-Were-Optimizing-It-135973&quot;&gt;T-Mobile has claimed &lt;/a&gt;that this practice isn&#039;t really &quot;throttling,&quot; but we disagree. It&#039;s clearly not &quot;optimization,&quot; since T-Mobile doesn&#039;t alter the actual content of the video streams in any way. Even the term &quot;downgrading&quot; is inaccurate, because that would mean video streams are simply being given a lower priority than other traffic. If that were true, then in the absence of higher priority traffic, videos should stream at the same throughput as any other content. But that&#039;s not the case: our tests show that video streams are capped at around 1.5Mbps, even when the LTE connection and the rest of T-Mobile&#039;s network can support higher throughput between the customer and the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In other words, our results show that T-Mobile is throttling video streams, plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Dear T-Mobile: Stop Futzing With Your Customer’s Traffic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Setting aside for the moment the question of when zero-rating constitutes a violation of net neutrality in and of itself (more on that later), it’s pretty obvious that throttling all traffic based on application type &lt;i&gt;definitely&lt;/i&gt; violates the principles of net neutrality. It also obviously violates the FCC’s Open Internet Order, which says that ISPs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;“…shall not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of Internet content, application, or service…subject to reasonable network management”,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;especially since throttling traffic independently of congestion (as T-Mobile is doing) makes it clear that this throttling is not being used for reasonable network management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;What should T-Mobile do instead? One option would be to stop throttling the video of providers who haven’t signed up to be zero-rated in Binge On, regardless of the status of the T-Mobile customer. This would address the complaints of video providers, since only edge providers who actually chose to be throttled would have their videos throttled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;But the best option would be to make Binge On opt-in (instead of opt-out), with clear disclosure that opting in will throttle all video traffic. Many of T-Mobile’s customers don’t realize that Binge On has this unfortunate side effect―especially since T-Mobile has buried the fact that Binge On throttles all video in their fine print. If T-Mobile were to be clear with its customers that enabling Binge On meant all of their video would be throttled, and then ask them whether or not they wanted to opt in, then they could obtain meaningful customer consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;As an aside, it’s also obvious that T-Mobile is capable of recognizing video streams from providers who aren’t enrolled in Binge On. Given that, we don’t understand why they require providers to enroll in Binge On in order to get their videos zero-rated. If T-Mobile truly wants to be neutral, then all throttled videos should be exempt from customer data caps.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Of course, this entire argument operates on the assumption that data caps are necessary on mobile networks, since zero-rating only makes sense when there’s a cap for data to be exempt from. And even if you accept that data caps are necessary, whether or not zero-rating is a neutral practice is a completely separate question. Either way, however, we don’t think exemptions from data caps should necessarily be heralded as pro-customer moves—but these are topics for a separate blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The FCC Should Investigate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In the meantime, if T-Mobile doesn’t change its behavior then it’s up to the FCC to follow up. After all, the net neutrality rules aren’t just words on a piece of paper—they’re regulations meant to protect Internet users from precisely this sort of abuse of power by ISPs. We believe the FCC should regulate lightly, but our research suggests this is a significant consumer harm that runs afoul of well-established open internet principles. The FCC can and should step in and hold T-Mobile accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;footnote1_zyhw1el&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnote-label&quot; href=&quot;#footnoteref1_zyhw1el&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/a&gt; To be fair, T-Mobile’s plans don’t have traditional data caps—they just slow down to “2G” speeds once customers exceed a certain amount of data. With that said, a limit on data is still a limit on data—and we’ll call it a cap for the purposes of this post.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Report From the Student Privacy Frontlines: 2015 in Review   </title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/report-student-privacy-frontlines-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This year the fight to protect student privacy hit a boiling point with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/student-privacy/&quot;&gt;Spying on Students campaign&lt;/a&gt;, an effort to help students, parents, teachers, and school administrators learn more about the privacy issues surrounding school-issued devices and cloud services. We&#039;re also working to push vendors like Google to put students and their parents back in control of students’ private information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/student-privacy/schoolsurvey&quot;&gt;nationwide survey&lt;/a&gt; of schools’ practices and disclosure policies; provided answers to questions about the legal and technological landscape related to student privacy; and created a wealth of resources, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/guide-chromebook-privacy-settings-students?from=student-privacy&quot;&gt;guides&lt;/a&gt; for adjusting privacy settings on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/google-deceptively-tracks-students-internet-browsing-eff-says-complaint-federal-trade&quot;&gt;filed an FTC complaint against Google&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to rein in the company’s overbroad data mining of student personal information and its violation of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://studentprivacypledge.org/?page_id=45&quot;&gt;Student Privacy Pledge&lt;/a&gt;. Our investigation found that school-issued Google Chromebooks upload private student data to the cloud by default, including web history. Chromebooks also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/googles-student-tracking-isnt-limited-chrome-sync?from=student-privacy&quot;&gt;track students&lt;/a&gt; on school-assigned accounts when they navigate to Google-owned services that aren’t segregated as “educational” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/googles-student-tracking-isnt-limited-chrome-sync&quot;&gt;non-&quot;educational&quot; products&lt;/a&gt; include Google Maps, Google Books, and YouTube). We’re asking the FTC to stop Google from spying on students, and to order the deletion of student data that has been gathered and stored for no legitimate educational purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond EFF’s activities, others took important steps in creating state-specific legislation around educational data. The Data Quality Campaign, a nonprofit advocacy organization based in Washington, DC, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dataqualitycampaign.org/blog/2015/08/progress-on-privacy/&quot;&gt;found that in 2015 alone&lt;/a&gt;, 46 states introduced 182 bills—resulting in 15 states with 28 new laws—to protect student privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the federal level, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is nearing reauthorization, but failed to include significant student privacy protections or amendments to close the loopholes in existing federal law governing student privacy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/12/ESEA_reauthorization_student_data_privacy.html&quot;&gt;according to Education Week&lt;/a&gt;. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr2092&quot;&gt;Student Digital Privacy and Parental Rights Act of 2015&lt;/a&gt; would help protect&lt;br /&gt;
the privacy and security of student data in the hands of third parties, but has yet to even be reported by the committee, let alone brought to the House or Senate floor for a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption caption-center&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/19/state-student-data-privacy-legislation-map_10_20_2015_large.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Copyright Data Quality Campaign; reprinted with permission&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; width=&quot;526&quot; /&gt;Copyright: Data Quality Campaign; reproduced with permission&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also saw increased attention to student privacy from educational projects, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://learnsphere.org/&quot;&gt;LearnSphere&lt;/a&gt;, a data infrastructure “designed to enable educators […] to easily collaborate over shared data,” while &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamesandlearning.org/2015/08/10/new-project-tackles-unlocking-student-data-while-protecting-privacy/&quot;&gt;collecting minimal student information&lt;/a&gt; and placing a heavy emphasis on anonymity. Time will tell how well the project safeguards student privacy, but its cautionary approach is a step in the right direction. That concern was echoed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://aclum.org/app/uploads/2015/10/back_to_the_drawing_board_report_large_file_size.pdf&quot;&gt;an ACLU report&lt;/a&gt; released in the fall, which found that “student information systems make it easy for schools to share sensitive student records, including disciplinary information and immigration status, with third-party corporations.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.post-gazette.com/news/surveillance-society/2015/08/24/Surveillance-Society-Review-shows-few-safeguards-against-student-privacy-leaks/stories/201508240003&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; this year found that, of the 31 Pennsylvania school districts surveyed, “just 11 had documented procedures for checking that software and applications didn’t violate student privacy before teachers assigned them to students.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more and more school districts around the country adopt digital devices like laptops and tablets—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/03/googles-chromebooks-make-up-half-of-us-classroom-devices.html&quot;&gt;8.9 million devices were sold&lt;/a&gt; to K-12 schools and districts this year, half of them Google Chromebooks—protecting children’s personal data remains of paramount importance. Moving into 2016, we hope to see more aggressive legislation to protect student personal information, and to see parents, teachers, administrators, and tech vendors unite to defend student privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>5 Major Hacks of the Year: 2015 in review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/5-types-major-hacks-year-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are that you didn&#039;t go a few days without hearing the word &quot;cyber&quot; last year. It&#039;s for good reason. It was a year of data breaches and hacks, impacting the public and private sector alike. Congress used some of these incidents to fear-monger and pass fundamentally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/statement-finalized-congressional-cybersecurity-bill&quot;&gt;flawed legislation&lt;/a&gt;, chiefly the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), that didn&#039;t even address the basic problem of poor security practices. So as 2015 comes to a close, we thought we would revisit a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OPM Hack and Breaches Upon Breaches&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most attention-worthy of data breaches of 2015 was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) hack. OPM was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/we-told-you-so-opm-data-breach-reveals-not-only-lame-data-security-weak-legal&quot;&gt;victim of a breach&lt;/a&gt; that exposed the private information of 21 million Americans. But personal data was not the only thing on display—the OPM hack was a perfect demonstration of the government&#039;s own weak cyber security practices, and the inadequacy in remedies for individuals affected by the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were other significant incidents affecting the private sector, most notably &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/08/ashley-madison-hack-is-not-only-real-its-worse-than-we-thought/&quot;&gt;Ashley Madison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-anthem-is-warning-consumers-20150306-column.html&quot;&gt;Anthem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnet.com/news/data-breach-snags-data-from-15m-t-mobile-customers/&quot;&gt;Experian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/12/hello-kitty-hack/&quot;&gt;Hello Kitty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/04/21/hsbc_dump_customers_mortgage_data_on_web/&quot;&gt;HSBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2015/11/11/securus-hack-prison-phone-company-exposes-thousands-of-calls-lawyers-and-clients/&quot;&gt;Securus Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/read/hacker-obtained-childrens-headshots-and-chatlogs-from-toymaker-vtech&quot;&gt;VTech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Android Stagefright&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our personal devices weren&#039;t safe either. Researchers discovered a massive vulnerability in the Android operating system affecting millions of devices. The vulnerability, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/horror-horror-stagefright-androids-heart-darkness&quot;&gt;known as Stagefright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/horror-horror-stagefright-androids-heart-darkness&quot;&gt;,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; was contained deep in the code that handles processing and displaying images. The especially horrific part was that this vulnerability could be triggered simply by sending the victim a specially crafted text message. Google has since released a patch fixing the vulnerability, but many devices could still remain affected and unpatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Botnet of Things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet! It&#039;s everywhere! More and more household (and non-household) items are being connected to the Internet, a phenomenon known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Unfortunately, with this explosion of Internet-connected devices came equally explosive security vulnerabilities. Hackers demonstrated the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/&quot;&gt;remotely control Jeep vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, taking over the steering wheel and even disabling the brakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security researcher Runa Sandvik discovered that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-can-disable-sniper-rifleor-change-target/&quot;&gt;wifi-enabled smart-rifle&lt;/a&gt; could be hacked to cause it to mis-target. &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/09/attackers-install-highly-stealthy-backdoors-in-cisco-routers/&quot;&gt;Multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/01/backdoor-in-wireless-dsl-routers-lets-attacker-reset-router-get-admin/&quot;&gt;backdoors&lt;/a&gt; in consumer routers were found, and even your refrigerator &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/08/24/smart_fridge_security_fubar/&quot;&gt;could be vulnerable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.networkworld.com/article/2976270/internet-of-things/smart-refrigerator-hack-exposes-gmail-login-credentials.html&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Even the Barbie dolls that you bought for your children for Christmas &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/12/04/hello-hackable-barbie/&quot;&gt;are not safe&lt;/a&gt;. We hope that manufacturers of Internet-connected devices will take security more seriously in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hacking Team Hacked&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of schadenfreude at the news that the Hacking Team, a known purveyor of spying tools to oppressive regimes, was itself targeted by hackers. The notorious Italy-based spyware vendor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/06/hacking-team-hacked-firm-sold-spying-tools-to-repressive-regimes-documents-claim&quot;&gt;had its own servers compromised&lt;/a&gt;, with attackers &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/07/massive-leak-reveals-hacking-teams-most-private-moments-in-messy-detail/&quot;&gt;releasing&lt;/a&gt; over 400GB of internal data and communications with clients. The releases included revelations of dealings with regimes targeting activists and journalists, including Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Russia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equation Group&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nation-state actors aren&#039;t just using off-the-shelf spying tools by outfits like Hacking Team, but are busily developing their own. Researchers at Kaspersky Labs discovered a family of malware, developed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/russian-researchers-uncover-sophisticated-malware-equation-group&quot;&gt;Equation Group&lt;/a&gt;, that could insert itself in the firmware of a number of different brands of hard drives. This malware could then easily persist on that machine, reinstalling itself from a secret sector on the hard drive even if the operating system was completely reinstalled. Due to the complexity of the malware, it is likely that the Equation Group is state-sponsored, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyberspying-idUSKBN0LK1QV20150217&quot;&gt;Reuters quoted&lt;/a&gt; anonymous former employees of NSA who claimed that the malware was directly developed by the Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were more examples of state-sponsored malware attacks. One was a spear-phishing campaign which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/new-spear-phishing-campaign-pretends-be-eff&quot;&gt;masqueraded as EFF itself&lt;/a&gt;. Another one was discovered on the devices of the late &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2015/08/21/inside-the-spyware-campaign-against-argentine-troublemakers-including-alberto-nisman/&quot;&gt;Alberto Nisman, an Argentine prosecutor&lt;/a&gt;, and linked by Citizenlab to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.org/2015/12/packrat-report/&quot;&gt;larger malware campaign in South America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-sponsored malware and attack campaigns highlight the terrifying capabilities of nation-state actors and reinforce the importance of security best practices and rejecting backdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EFF Fights for the Public&#039;s Right to Know: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/2015-review-more-government-secrecy-means-more-litigation</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2015 was a busy year for transparency at EFF. We are currently litigating 10 different public records cases—the highest number of transparency cases EFF has had pending at one time in our 25 year history. The majority of the cases are in federal courts (in San Francisco and Washington, D.C.), although we have two cases pending in California state courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a brief, year-end rundown of each case, including what we’re after, who we sued, and the status of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEDERAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT LAWSUITS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/foia/federal-dna-collection&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid DNA Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we’re after&lt;/em&gt;&lt;i&gt;:&lt;/i&gt; Records related to the FBI’s use of Rapid DNA analyzers—technology that allows non-scientists outside a lab to extract a DNA profile from a sample in less than 90 minutes—and their plans to integrate rapidly generated profiles into the FBI’s DNA databases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who we sued:&lt;/em&gt; FBI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Status of the case&lt;/em&gt;&lt;i&gt;:&lt;/i&gt; After initially (and incorrectly) informing us that only a few records existed, the government agreed to go back and conduct another search for records responsive to our request. They are in the process of finalizing that search and plan to release the first batch of records before the end of 2015 and the second batch in early 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/government-must-come-clean-about-exports-american-made-spying-tools&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export Controls Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we’re after&lt;/em&gt;: Applications submitted by tech companies for the export of surveillance technology to countries around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who we sued&lt;/em&gt;&lt;i&gt;: &lt;/i&gt;Department of Commerce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Status of the case&lt;/em&gt;: The case was recently remanded from the federal Court of Appeals back to the district court to decide whether a new law—passed after we filed our lawsuit—exempts the records from disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/foia/fisc-orders-illegal-government-surveillance&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FISC Opinion Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we’re after&lt;/em&gt;: A single opinion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that dealt with the NSA’s attempted use of illegally collected communications through its upstream surveillance program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who we sued&lt;/em&gt;: The Department of Justice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Status of the case&lt;/em&gt;: The district court granted the government’s motion for summary judgment in October. We are currently considering our next steps, including the possibility of an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/us-marshals-airborne-imsi-catchers&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dirtbox Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we’re after&lt;/em&gt;: Records related to the U.S. Marshal Service’s use of small aircraft mounted with controversial cell-phone tracking systems known as “Dirtboxes.” Dirtboxes are an airborne IMSI catcher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who we sued&lt;/em&gt;: The Department of Justice, FBI, and the Marshal’s Service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Status of the case&lt;/em&gt;: All three agencies are processing and releasing documents responsive to our request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we’re after&lt;/em&gt;: Records related to the award-winning journalist Laura Poitras’ repeated detention and questioning  as she crossed the U.S. border between 2006 and 2012. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who we sued&lt;/em&gt;: Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Status of the case&lt;/em&gt;: The government has released some records and has indicated that it will continue searching for responsive documents until early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/eff-v-nsa-odni-vulnerabilities-foia&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0-Day Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we’re after&lt;/em&gt;: Records related to the government’s development and use of a Vulnerabilities Equities Process—the internal government process that assesses when to disclose, and when to use, zero days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who we sued&lt;/em&gt;: National Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Status of the case&lt;/em&gt;: The government released document describing its Vulnerabilities Equities Process to us in September.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we’re afte&lt;/em&gt;r: Records related to “Hemisphere,” a collaboration between AT&amp;amp;T, the DEA, and other law enforcement officials, that allows law enforcement to access detailed phone records and conduct complicated analysis and datamining of those records.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who we sued&lt;/em&gt;: The Department of Justice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Status of the case&lt;/em&gt;: The DEA has released all records it believes are responsive to our request but the records are significantly redacted. We will be challenging the redactions in cross motions for summary judgment in Spring 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT LAWSUITS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/hemisphere&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State Hemisphere Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Open Access Movement Demands More: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/open-access-movement-demands-more-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In October 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/11/editors-of-the-journal-lingua-protest-quit-in-battle-for-open-access/&quot;&gt;all six editors of the linguistics journal &lt;i&gt;Lingua&lt;/i&gt; quit at once&lt;/a&gt;, along with its 31-member editorial board. The walkout brought mainstream attention to a debate that has been brewing for years over the future of academic publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsevier—&lt;i&gt;Lingua&lt;/i&gt;’s publisher—classifies it as a hybrid journal. By default, &lt;i&gt;Lingua&lt;/i&gt; is available only to subscribers (or to institutions that purchase access to journals in bulk). Individual writers can choose to have their articles shared openly if they pay an additional fee. In principle, there’s nothing wrong with those fees—most major open journals have article processing charges, as do many closed journals. But &lt;i&gt;Lingua&lt;/i&gt;’s editors believed that their journal’s fee was prohibitively high and didn’t correspond to increased support from Elsevier. The same team is planning to launch a new journal next year with the growing open access publisher &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubiquitypress.com/&quot;&gt;Ubiquity Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, what happened at &lt;i&gt;Lingua&lt;/i&gt; is emblematic of something that’s been happening all year. If &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/12/2014-review-open-access-broadens-moves-forward&quot;&gt;2014 was the year that the open access movement became mainstream&lt;/a&gt;, then this is the year we stopped compromising with closed publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest tactics the open access movement can use to effect change is encouraging research funders to adopt open access policies—that is, policies that require that any work they fund be shared openly. Creative Commons reports that in 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stateof.creativecommons.org/2015/cc-sotc-2015-xx09.html&quot;&gt;five major foundations adopted policies&lt;/a&gt; requiring any research they fund to be published under an open license: the Ford Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Wikimedia Foundation, and the Vancouver Foundation. The grants those foundations gave out under their new policies accounted for nearly two billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important goal we haven’t achieved yet is passing an open access mandate for federally funded research. FASTR (the Fair Access to Science &amp;amp; Technology Research Act) was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/locking-public-access-scientific-knowledge-unlocking-scholarly-research&quot;&gt;reintroduced in Congress in March&lt;/a&gt; after floundering in 2013. Under FASTR, any federal agency that gives over $100 million in grants for research would be required to adopt an open access policy. We don’t think FASTR is a perfect bill—ideally, any public access mandate would require that research be openly licensed—but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/fastr-ensures-publicly-funded-research-belongs-public&quot;&gt;we think that it’s a crucial first step&lt;/a&gt;. It has strong supporters in both parties, but lawmakers need their constituents’ encouragement to make FASTR a priority. Many of you have used our site to &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/secure-open-access-to-taxpayer-funded-research&quot;&gt;write to your Senators and Representatives about FASTR&lt;/a&gt;, but we still urgently need to get the message to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 was also a year when unauthorized sharing of academic works became a lot more visible. Let’s not kid ourselves—people have always emailed papers to each other to get around paywalls, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/open-access-human-rights-issue&quot;&gt;the rise in trends like #icanhazpdf&lt;/a&gt; speaks to an academic community that’s increasingly vocal about its frustrations with traditional publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we might remember 2015 as academic publishers’ Napster moment. Through engaging in an endless hide-and-seek game with &lt;a href=&quot;/deeplinks/2015/12/what-if-elsevier-and-researchers-quit-playing-hide-and-seek&quot;&gt;rogue repositories like Sci-Hub and LibGen&lt;/a&gt;, Elsevier may be slowly coming to terms with the fact that its business model has fallen out of sync with reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;align-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/let-s-stand-together-to-promote-open-access-worldwide&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2014/09/18/diego_gomez-2b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Support Diego. Join the open access movement.&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/diego-stands-trial-today-show-your-support-open-access&quot;&gt;we remember Diego Gomez&lt;/a&gt;, who may face eight years in prison for sharing a scientific paper online. Since Diego’s trial began in June, &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/let-s-stand-together-to-promote-open-access-worldwide&quot;&gt;over 20,000 of you have signed EFF’s petition in support of open access&lt;/a&gt;. Stories like his are a reminder of the urgent need for major open access reform worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s an entire journal staff quitting their jobs, a foundation approving an open access policy, or even a student going on Twitter to get around a paywall, 2015 was a year when a lot of people questioned why closed is the default. Let’s keep that momentum going by passing a federal open access mandate in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Governments Taking Techies Offline: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/too-familiar-story-technologists-jail-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The real test of whether you have rights is not what the law says: it&#039;s what happens when you try to exercise them. For too many bloggers and technologist around the world, the price of using the Net in innovative, legitimate ways, has been jail. Some of the cases of imprisonment around the world that we&#039;ve tracked the most closely were freed in 2015, but others continue to languish in need of our support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 9 bloggers freed in Ethiopia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s been one undeniably happy ending for this year even if it is for a tale that should never have had to have beeen told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/offline/zone-9-bloggers&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/zone-9-banner-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-left&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/eff-calls-release-ethiopian-dissident-bloggers&quot;&gt;six Ethiopians&lt;/a&gt; were arrested based on their online criticism of Ethiopia&#039;s current situation on their shared blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://zone9ethio.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Zone 9&lt;/a&gt;. The government&#039;s accusations of &quot;terrorism&quot; revolved around a familiar story: their research into digital security and secure encryption software allegedly indicated malicious intent. Technical knowledge was transformed by their accusers into a sign of imminent violence and subversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighteen months later, and a month after EFF highlighted their case as part of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/offline&quot;&gt;Offline campaign against jailed technologists and bloggers&lt;/a&gt;, the last of the Zone 9 bloggers were acquitted and freed. Those bloggers should never have been arrested, but at least the story of their detention ends with some hint of justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bassel Khartabil facing torture, execution in Syria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/offline/bassel-khartabil&quot;&gt;Bassel Khartabil&lt;/a&gt;, a Syrian technologist seized off the streets of Damascus by the Assad government in 2011, this year ends with a turn for the worse. At the beginning of this year, Bassel was uncomfortable and unjustly but stably held in Syria&#039;s Adra prison. In October, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/fears-grow-safety-imprisoned-syrian-open-source-developer-bassel-khartabil&quot;&gt;we heard&lt;/a&gt; that he had been taken from his cell, removed into the shadowy world of Assad&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Mahabharat&lt;/i&gt;, what Human Rights Watch calls Syria&#039;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/07/03/torture-archipelago/arbitrary-arrests-torture-and-enforced-disappearances-syrias&quot;&gt;torture archipelago&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/offline/bassel-khartabil&quot; class=&quot;offline-card&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/09/23/bassel-banner-1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Bassel&#039;s wife heard that Bassel may have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/igf-2015-flyer-bassel-khartabil&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; by a secret court. No confirmation or denial has come from the Assad regime, leaving Bassel&#039;s family, friends and supporters deeply worried about his current status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bassel was detained because he was a prominent figure in Syria&#039;s tech community. His story, as ever, is tied far less to his own actions than to the ongoing politics of the Syrian civil war. Whatever their intentions, the Syrian authorities can serve justice and transparency by confirming Bassel&#039;s current condition and whereabouts through official channels. At a time when so many have their attention on Syria, they have the power to turn this sordid case of a man unfairly taken from his wife and family into a rare story of clemency in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canadian Saeed Malekpour imprisoned for life in Iran&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we need to tell stories just to add structure to an arbitrary and inexplicable world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/offline/saeed-malekpour&quot; class=&quot;offline-card&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/09/23/saeed-banner-1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/offline/saeed-malekpour&quot;&gt;Saeed Malekpour&lt;/a&gt; is a Canadian-Iranian who has, by every account, played no role in the politics of modern Iran. He was happily employed in British Columbia as a web developer in 2008, when he traveled to Iran to visit his sick father. While there, he was seized by members of the Revolutionary Guard and accused of being an accomplice in developing Iranian pornography websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flimsiest of evidence was enough to sentence Malekpour to death, and although that sentence was successfully challenged, he remains imprisoned for life. Saeed&#039;s story is terrifying: a family visit that turned into an incomprehensible punishment. Iran&#039;s Supreme Leader has the power to pardon him and set him free. As with Bassel, one simple statement by a powerful leader could end an ongoing tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope 2016 will be better for Bassel, Saeed, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/offline/&quot;&gt;our other ongoing Offline cases&lt;/a&gt;, Egypt&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/offline/alaa-abd-el-fattah&quot;&gt;Alaa Abd El Fattah&lt;/a&gt;, and Ethiopia&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/offline/eskinder-nega&quot;&gt;Eskinder Nega&lt;/a&gt;. In many cases, that means hoping that key figures in their countries intercede on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governments telling wild stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we want to end the need to draw attention to horrific tales of technologists imprisoned and sentenced to death, &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; government, including those in the US and Europe, should stop weaving their own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/12/david-cameron-pledges-anti-terror-law-internet-paris-attacks-nick-clegg&quot;&gt;horror stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments all around the world have spent the end of 2015 telling the public and each other wild stories about the supposed dangers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/09/fbi-director-tech-companies-backdoors-user-data-access-counter-terrorism&quot;&gt;encryption&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/12/france-looking-at-banning-tor-blocking-public-wi-fi/&quot;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;. These exaggerated fictions feed decisions to punish innocent technologists around the world. We who remain online can stand in solidarity with--and learn a great deal from--those whose voices have been taken &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/offline&quot;&gt;Offline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Net Neutrality and More: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/net-neutrality-and-more-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to net neutrality, 2015 started off with a blast. In February the FCC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/huge-win-open-internet-fcc-officially-embraces-title-ii&quot;&gt;reclassified retail broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service&lt;/a&gt;, and issued strong new net neutrality rules while forbearing from almost all the other Title II regulations. In other words, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/fcc-votes-net-neutrality-big-win&quot;&gt;Team Internet started the year off with a huge victory&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/todays-net-neutrality-order-win-few-blemishes&quot;&gt;with a few caveats&lt;/a&gt;, which we’ll return to at the end).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Of course, the rules were quickly challenged by the ISPs in court. In order to help defend the rules, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/network-engineers-weigh-support-open-internet&quot;&gt;we gathered an all-star list of computer science professors and Internet engineers&lt;/a&gt; to explain to the court just how vital net neutrality has been in helping the Internet grow and flourish. The case itself was heard by the court in early December; it will likely be many months before we find out whether or not the court was persuaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In the meantime, net neutrality wasn’t the only issue that brought the FCC onto EFF’s radar this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In November, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/fccs-dnt-decision-right-call-now&quot;&gt;FCC announced that it would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; create regulations requiring websites to honor Do Not Track requests&lt;/a&gt;. (DNT requests are signals web browsers send to websites to indicate that users don’t want to be tracked or profiled—the same requests &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/privacybadger&quot;&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt; is designed to enforce.) While we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/clear-rules-road-do-not-track-policy-0&quot;&gt;huge fans of DNT&lt;/a&gt; (and wish all websites would honor DNT requests), this was the right call by the FCC. It reinforced that the FCC would not be getting into the business of regulating websites, despite the fear mongering of net neutrality opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;And speaking of the potential for FCC over-regulation, we also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/hurricane-lte-u-dont-let-wi-fi-get-blown-away&quot;&gt;wrote in November about another tricky situation that requires the FCC to strike the right regulatory balance&lt;/a&gt;: the push by Qualcomm and several mobile telcos to start using LTE-U technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;LTE-U refers to a proposal by telcos to expand their LTE networks outside their traditional, licensed ranges and into some of the same unlicensed radio spectrum currently used by Wi-Fi and other consumer technology. While this might mean faster download speeds for telco customers, LTE-U could also end up interfering with Wi-Fi signals. (For an in-depth technical description of how, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/hurricane-lte-u-dont-let-wi-fi-get-blown-away&quot;&gt;check out our blog post on the issue&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Despite the possibility of interference, we wrote that FCC regulation of LTE-U (or more regulation of the unlicensed spectrum in general) wasn’t the right answer. Instead, the FCC should watch the deployment of LTE-U closely, and if LTE-U causes widespread interference with Wi-Fi, enforce existing regulations which forbid “knowing interference.” In other words, if LTE-U doesn’t play nice with other technology in practice, then (and only then) should the FCC step in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;All of these events share an underlying theme: that the FCC has a delicate balancing act to maintain when it comes to regulating technology, and that we need to be vigilant in order to ensure it maintains that balance. Whether it’s how the FCC handles LTE-U, how it deals with the battle brewing over zero-rating, or how it applies its “general conduct” rule (which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/fcc-keeping-eye-interconnection-more-clarity-needed&quot;&gt;we’ve expressed concerns about&lt;/a&gt;), you can be sure that we’ll be keeping a close eye on the FCC in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Victories in California and Virginia Alongside a Setback in Florida: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/victories-california-and-virginia-alongside-setback-florida-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Congress took action in 2015 to address privacy and transparency, but state legislatures emerged as the nation’s leaders for policy innovation. From Virginia to California, states adopted new policies to reclaim digital privacy, advance government transparency, and protect free expression. These new laws both protect residents of these states, and also provide models for other jurisdictions to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 2015, EFF and our grassroots supporters helped secure a series of important victories for privacy and transparency in California and Virginia, while enduring a disappointing setback in Florida undermining privacy and freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;California adopts groundbreaking protections for privacy, transparency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work was largely successful in California, where we helped secure three new laws to advance privacy and transparency in law enforcement, a fourth promoting transparency by other local agencies, and stopped two bills that, if successful, would have eroded anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Securing “the nation’s best digital privacy law”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of California’s new laws, known as the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (or CalECPA), was introduced as &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB178&quot;&gt;S.B. 178&lt;/a&gt; by Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) alongside Republican Sen. Joel Anderson (R-Alpine). Described by &lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt; magazine as “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/10/california-now-nations-best-digital-privacy-law/&quot;&gt;the nation’s best digital privacy law&lt;/a&gt;,” CalECPA garnered broad support not only from privacy advocates like EFF, the ACLU, and the California Newspaper Publishers Association, but also technology companies from Google and Apple to LinkedIn and Twitter, and even the San Diego Police Officers Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By requiring police to obtain a warrant from a neutral judge in order to search stored communications like email in the cloud, CalECPA enshrines some of the nation&#039;s most protective privacy standards. It helps restrict otherwise arbitrary electronic surveillance, protecting both the content and location data of email and other digital communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other states—Maine and Utah—have adopted similarly broad digital privacy protections. Yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/california-leads-way-digital-privacy&quot;&gt;California’s decision represents a sea change&lt;/a&gt; because it is the home of both the technology and entertainment sectors, as well as the world’s seventh largest economy when compared to those of other countries. As my colleague Dave Maass &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/success-sacramento-four-new-laws-one-veto-all-victories-privacy-and-transparency&quot;&gt;recently wrote&lt;/a&gt;, “because so many technological companies are headquartered here…[a] new law in California can have nation-wide, and potentially global, ramifications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Promoting transparency and security in law enforcement surveillance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other new California laws restrict the uses of high-tech surveillance tools used by law enforcement authorities and private actors: &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB34&quot;&gt;S.B. 34&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB741&quot;&gt;S.B. 741&lt;/a&gt; were introduced by Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo) and contain provisions imposing similar limits on two sets of surveillance methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;S.B. 34 addresses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/sls/tech/automated-license-plate-readers&quot;&gt;automated license plate recognition systems (ALPR)&lt;/a&gt;, high-speed camera systems often mounted on police cars or light poles that capture an image and metadata such as time, date, and location whenever a license plate comes into view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S.B. 741 addresses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/sls/tech/cell-site-simulators&quot;&gt;IMSI catchers&lt;/a&gt;—commonly known by the brand “Stingray”—devices that mimic a cell phone tower in order to record data flowing through it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these surveillance tools subject entire communities to monitoring without the individual basis for suspicion required under the Fourth Amendment to justify law enforcement scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new laws impose parallel restrictions on local agencies using Stingrays, and also create restrictions on local agencies, state agencies, and private contractors using ALPRs. They require local agencies to publicly post a usage and privacy policy, and also adopt “reasonable security procedures and practices, including operational, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards” to prevent potential data breaches. Finally, the new laws require law enforcement agencies seeking to use these tools to first disclose their plans and secure approval from local policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These measures create vital protections for privacy, transparency, and security. They also have teeth: both laws create rights of private action in the event of a data breach, placing members of the public in a position to represent the public interest. And because IMSI catchers like Stingrays monitor electronic communications, CalECPA also applies, requiring public agencies using them to secure a judicial warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stopping enhanced drivers licenses&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to EFF’s work in California addressing privacy and transparency to help restrain otherwise arbitrary law enforcement surveillance, we also championed both values in other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, along with supporters from across the state, we helped stop &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB249&quot;&gt;S.B. 249&lt;/a&gt;, a problematic bill that would have allowed the California Department of Motor Vehicles to begin issuing to enhanced driver licenses (EDLs), ID cards with embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chips. Purportedly proposed to relieve congestion at the San Diego border crossing, the bill would have created enormous security and privacy risks, potentially allowing anyone with an RFID reader to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/success-sacramento-four-new-laws-one-veto-all-victories-privacy-and-transparency&quot;&gt;discover the identities&lt;/a&gt; of drivers.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite proposals to protect privacy and civil liberties, such as a requirement that EDLs remain optional, the version of the bill ultimately passed by the legislature and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/sb-249-veto-message&quot;&gt;vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown&lt;/a&gt; would have allowed employers to discriminate against employees who declined to obtain an EDL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fighting the digital currency licensing scheme&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, EFF worked with allied organizations including Fight for the Future and Taskforce to &lt;a href=&quot;https://nobitcoinlicense.org/&quot;&gt;mobilize public support&lt;/a&gt; against a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/license-kill-innovation-why-ab-1326-californias-bitcoin-license-bad-business&quot;&gt;hasty and vague&lt;/a&gt; measure that would have required licenses for “virtual currency businesses” that maintain “full custody or control of virtual currency in [California] on behalf of others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meant to addresses digital currencies like Bitcoin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1326&quot;&gt;A.B. 1326&lt;/a&gt; threatened to create an array of problems from invasive data collection in the context of the proposed licensing scheme to technical inaccuracies in the measure’s definition of covered services. Over a dozen companies and non-profit groups joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/digital-rights-groups-team-tech-companies-fight-ab-1326-virtual-currency-license&quot;&gt;a coalition letter&lt;/a&gt; to state Senators noting “serious technical issues, due process concerns, and overbroad language,” pervading the proposal and urging them to “provide adequate time for informational hearings, testimony, and revisions to make this bill better for all Californians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the concerted efforts of supporters from across the state held the line and kept the proposal from finding its way into law this year, we anticipate the issue returning in 2016. &lt;a href=&quot;https://supporters.eff.org/get-effs-resources-community-and-campus-organizers&quot;&gt;Let us know&lt;/a&gt; if you’re willing to take action where you live when it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Advancing government disclosure and transparency&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our California campaigns promoting privacy achieved enormous success, our work advancing transparency attained more mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we supported an unsuccessful proposal in &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB573&quot;&gt;S.B. 573&lt;/a&gt; to create a Chief Data Officer (CDO) for the State of California. The CDO would have been authorized to create an open-data roadmap, open-data guidelines, an open-data working group, and a statewide open-data portal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we also supported a successful measure, &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB272&quot;&gt;S.B. 272&lt;/a&gt;, that enhanced the California Public Records Act (CPRA) by requiring local agencies to create a publicly accessible catalog of their enterprise data systems and the vendors that supply them. Ensuring transparency into vendor relationships “is important for ensuring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/open-data-bills-move-forward-california&quot;&gt;accountability in this age of outsourcing&lt;/a&gt;,” while the catalogs of enterprise data can help CPRA requestors find the public information they seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Virginia splits the difference&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting a consensus across the ideological and partisan spectrum, Virginia policymakers passed no fewer than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/virginia-governor-signs-warrant-requirement-drones-rejects-license-plate-reader&quot;&gt;three bills reinforcing the right to privacy by restraining mass surveillance&lt;/a&gt; by local and state authorities. Two of them became law following the approval of Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who rejected the third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the bills addressed different ambient surveillance methods, despite the common concerns surrounding each of their uses. Reflecting that similarity, two measures reiterated the constitutional warrant requirement, which law enforcement agencies have widely circumvented by classifying surveillance as intelligence collection, rather than a search subject to Fourth Amendment protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McAuliffe approved &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2015/hb1408/&quot;&gt;H.B. 1408&lt;/a&gt;, a measure requiring state &amp;amp; local police to &lt;a href=&quot;https://privacysos.org/node/1695&quot;&gt;secure a judicial warrant&lt;/a&gt; prior to using IMSI cell site emulators like Stingrays. Virginia’s policy proved prescient, predating by nearly six months &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-enhanced-policy-use-cell-site-simulators&quot;&gt;a similar policy at the federal level&lt;/a&gt; announced by the Justice Department in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to pressure from EFF supporters in Virginia, McAuliffe also signed into law &lt;a href=&quot;http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=151&amp;amp;typ=bil&amp;amp;val=Hb2125&amp;amp;submit=GO&quot;&gt;H.B. 2125&lt;/a&gt;, which similarly requires police to obtain a warrant before using drone aircraft to conduct surveillance. It also ensures that evidence obtained by drones without a supporting warrant can not be introduced as evidence supporting a criminal prosecution. Finally, the measure prohibits the deployment of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/all-eyes-virginia-lawmakers-face-major-surveillance-choices&quot;&gt;weaponized drones&lt;/a&gt; generally while permitting their use at two testing &amp;amp; training facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, McAuliffe chose to veto &lt;a href=&quot;http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=151&amp;amp;typ=bil&amp;amp;val=Hb1673&amp;amp;submit=GO&quot;&gt;H.B. 1673&lt;/a&gt;, which lawmakers passed to force police to purge after one week data collected from “any surveillance technology,” including tools deployed today and those that may emerge in the future. Gov. McAuliffe first sought to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/03/27/va-gov-mcauliffe-amends-license-plate-reader-bill-angers-legislators/&quot;&gt;unilaterally narrow the bill&lt;/a&gt; to address only ALPR data, which co-sponsor Del. Chap Petersen (D-Fairfax) described as “essentially destroying the bill,” and “completely miss[ing] the point of the legislation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McAuliffe’s rejection of H.B. 1673 is especially striking because retention of ALPR data had already been unauthorized since 2013, when the state’s then-Attorney General, Ken Cuccinelli, &lt;a href=&quot;https://acluva.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NealvFairfaxCoResponseToDemurrer.pdf&quot;&gt;concluded &lt;/a&gt;as the state’s chief prosecutor that existing state law did not support it. State legislators proposed the bill in 2015 only after news reports revealed that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/despite-cuccinellis-advice-nva-police-still-maintaining-databases-of-license-plates/2014/01/16/055ec09a-7e38-11e3-9556-4a4bf7bcbd84_story.html&quot;&gt;police departments were violating the rule&lt;/a&gt; by retaining ALPR data for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite McAuliffe’s veto of H.B. 1673, his approval of H.B. 1408 and H.B. 2125 established a mixed record for 2015. Virginia state legislators, in contrast, took assertive action by trying to include “any surveillance technology” among those limited by its reform legislation. Their concerns will likely re-emerge in 2016, suggesting opportunities for constituents to continue educating the Governor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Florida steps back, undermining anonymity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to our work in Sacramento and Charlottesville, our efforts met with less success in Tallahassee. &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/stop-florida-s-unconstitutional-plan-to-outlaw-anonymous-speech&quot;&gt;EFF marshaled supporters&lt;/a&gt; in Florida to challenge &lt;a href=&quot;http://myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=53294&quot;&gt;H.B. 271&lt;/a&gt;, the True Origin of Digital Goods Act (TODGA), only to watch the bill become law in spite of our efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proposal to undermine anonymity and freedom of expression in the guise of a “consumer protection” reform advancing the interests of major entertainment companies, TODGA requires any website or Internet service operator &quot;dealing in substantial part in the electronic dissemination of commercial recordings or audiovisual works” to “disclose his or her true and correct name, physical address, and telephone number or e-mail address.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modeled on similar laws that in other states have been used to justify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/florida-outlawing-anonymous-speech&quot;&gt;police raids of music studios&lt;/a&gt;, the bill could be used to unmask even anonymous bloggers or musicians. TODGA also raises constitutional problems given its intrusion on the federal government’s authority to regulate interstate commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are disappointed that TODGA has become law in Florida, since it enhanced the enforcement powers of corporate copyright holders, while undermining both anonymity and freedom of expression. On the other hand, EFF’s work did soften the law’s harmful impacts by adding an exemption for websites and services that distribute the site owner’s own creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fighting for your rights wherever we can&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of concerned grassroots activists and organizers around the country, we plan to expand our reach to address more state legislatures in future legislative sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Encryption in the Balance: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/encryption-balance-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;If you’ve spent any time reading about encryption this year, you know we’re in the midst of a “debate.” You may have also noted that it’s a strange debate, one that largely replays the same arguments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/fbis-revival-crypto-wars-part-ii-continues-two-hearings-congress&quot;&gt;made nearly 20 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, when the government abandoned its attempts to mandate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crypto.com/papers/eesproto.pdf&quot;&gt;weakened encryption and backdoors&lt;/a&gt;. Now some parts of the government have been trying to revisit that decision in the name of achieving “balance” between user security and public safety. The FBI, for example, acknowledges that widespread adoption of encryption has benefits for users, but it also claims its investigations of terrorists, criminals, and other wrongdoers will “go dark” unless it has a legal authority and the technical capability to read encrypted data. But because the principles of what makes encryption secure haven’t changed, the only “balance” that can satisfy the government’s goals is no balance at all—it would require dramatically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/deep-dive-crypto-exceptional-access-mandates-effective-or-constitutional-pick-one&quot;&gt;rolling back&lt;/a&gt; the spread of strong encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;EFF has spent the past few months explaining the danger of the FBI’s demand, and mobilizing users to push back. And while the recent tragic attacks in Paris and San Bernardino have only increased the FBI’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/baseless-calls-expand-surveillance-fit-familiar-cynical-pattern&quot;&gt; (misguided) pressure to weaken encryption&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve also had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/we-did-it-100000-people-call-obama-support-strong-crypto&quot;&gt;real success in using grassroots advocacy&lt;/a&gt; to call on the president to support encryption. Here are some of the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magical Thinking on Golden Keys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;One of the biggest proponents of a “balanced” solution to the so-called Going Dark problem is FBI Director James Comey. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/fbis-revival-crypto-wars-part-ii-continues-two-hearings-congress&quot;&gt;hearings in July&lt;/a&gt; and again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/no-matter-what-fbi-says-compromising-encryption-technical-issue&quot;&gt;this month&lt;/a&gt;, Comey has claimed that because some companies offer non-end-to-end encrypted communications tools, that’s proof that there is a way to achieve both user security and law enforcement access. He’s been backed up by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/putting-the-digital-keys-to-unlock-data-out-of-reach-of-authorities/2015/07/18/d6aa7970-2beb-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post editorial board&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/it-again-law-enforcement-officials-anti-encryption-new-york-times-op-ed&quot;&gt;state and local law enforcement officials&lt;/a&gt; who all call on geniuses in Silicon Valley to “figure out” the balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;The problem is that they don’t seem to have listened to the geniuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;In fact, pushing back on the other side of this debate is a unified coalition of technologists, mega technology companies, and privacy advocates with a remarkably consistent message: weakening encryption is a terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;First up was an all-star group of cryptography experts who argued against government mandates for the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures&quot;&gt;Clipper Chip&lt;/a&gt; in the 90’s and reconvened to&lt;a href=&quot;http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/97690/MIT-CSAIL-TR-2015-026.pdf?sequence=8&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/97690/MIT-CSAIL-TR-2015-026.pdf?sequence=8&quot;&gt;publish a paper&lt;/a&gt; in July rigorously analyzing a number of possible legislative mandates. As before, they concluded that inclusion of key escrow code that would siphon off key material to any third party would necessarily increase code complexity, in turn increasing the likelihood of security vulnerabilities and putting users at increased risk. They also noted that any organization (or set of organizations, with&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing&quot;&gt;split-key&lt;/a&gt; schemas) holding &quot;golden key&quot; access to consumer devices would be a huge target for hackers. As recent compromises of such sensitive data as the employee records and fingerprints for&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/opm-hack-fingerprints/406900/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/opm-hack-fingerprints/406900/&quot;&gt;5.6 million government employees&lt;/a&gt; stored by the Office Of Personnel Management show, centralized high-risk databases can become targets for compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;What &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; changed since the initial report is the scale of encrypted communications that we rely on in our daily lives—from online transactions and HTTPS to device encryption and consumer security systems. A compromise in the 90s would have been very bad, but today it would be absolutely devastating. Finally, the experts point out important international governance questions that would have to be answered along with any mandate. Chief among these questions is whether encryption apps developed in the U.S. but intended for use in despotic regimes would be subject to similar key escrow systems based in those regimes. The intelligence community has offered no answers to these problematic looming questions. Nor have they explained how they could regulate the sizable number of open source and/or international encrypted apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, many of the biggest tech companies have also taken &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/where-do-major-tech-companies-stand-encryption&quot;&gt;strong pro-encryption stances&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/eff-applauds-apples-refusal-government-demand-imessage-backdoor&quot;&gt;most noteworthy is Apple&lt;/a&gt;, which fought back against a court order demanding that it turn over communications by users of their iMessage app. Apple responded that the iMessage platform protects users with strong, end-to-end encryption, so Apple could not decrypt existing messages and was unwilling to jeopardize the security of its customers by building in a backdoor to compromise future communications. The government eventually backed off, but only after Apple delivered unencrypted iCloud backups of some of the messages in question. Apple CEO Tim Cook has&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/apple-ceo-tim-cook-blasts-encryption-backdoors/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/apple-ceo-tim-cook-blasts-encryption-backdoors/&quot;&gt;vociferously opposed&lt;/a&gt; any new backdoor mandates, echoing cryptography experts with the statement &quot;you can’t have a back door that’s only for the good guys.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;Google, which has made full-disk encryption&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/android-6-0-re-implements-mandatory-device-encryption-for-new-devices/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/android-6-0-re-implements-mandatory-device-encryption-for-new-devices/&quot;&gt;mandatory&lt;/a&gt; for smartphones running Android Marshmallow, joined Apple as well as over 140 other organizations and individuals (including EFF) in a&lt;a href=&quot;https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/3138--113/Encryption_Letter_to_Obama_final_051915.pdf&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/3138--113/Encryption_Letter_to_Obama_final_051915.pdf&quot;&gt;joint letter&lt;/a&gt; delivered to President Obama in late May urging the administration to reject any proposal weakening the security of their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;More recently, the Information Technology Industry Council, a tech trade association of the 62 largest global tech firms, issued a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itic.org/news-events/news-releases/tech-responds-to-calls-to-weaken-encryption&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itic.org/news-events/news-releases/tech-responds-to-calls-to-weaken-encryption&quot;&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; explaining that encryption &quot;is a security tool we rely on everyday to stop criminals&quot; and &quot;preserve our security and safety,&quot; concluding that &quot;weakening security with the aim of advancing security simply does not make sense.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Save Crypto&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;Above all, individual Americans don’t want the government to have backdoor access to their communications, and EFF has been working to help the government hear that message. On September 30, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.accessnow.org/&quot;&gt;Access Now&lt;/a&gt; , we launched&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/tell-president-obama-save-crypto-dangerous-backdoors&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/tell-president-obama-save-crypto-dangerous-backdoors&quot;&gt;SaveCrypto.org&lt;/a&gt; as a way to let the public have its voice heard. Over 104,000 people signed on to a statement rejecting &quot;any law, policy, or mandate that would undermine our security&quot; and demanding &quot;privacy, security, and integrity for our communications and systems&quot;— enough to warrant an official public response by the White House. Despite the president’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://recode.net/2015/02/15/white-house-red-chair-obama-meets-swisher/&quot;&gt;support for “strong encryption,&lt;/a&gt;” the White House’s initial response to the petition was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/save-crypto-tell-white-house-we-cant-sacrifice-security&quot;&gt;underwhelming&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;In the midst of this action, a series of leaks to the Washington Post revealed that the Obama administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/partial-victory-obama-encryption-policy-reject-laws-mandating-backdoors-leaves&quot;&gt;won’t seek legislation for now&lt;/a&gt;. (Though that hasn’t stopped Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance from introducing his own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justsecurity.org/28202/cy-vances-proposal-backdoor-encrypted-devices-riddled-vulnerabilities/&quot;&gt;deeply flawed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://manhattanda.org/sites/default/files/11.18.15%20Report%20on%20Smartphone%20Encryption%20and%20Public%20Safety.pdf&quot;&gt;model bill&lt;/a&gt;.) But statements by Comey and others suggest the government will instead try to privately pressure companies to weaken their own products. That’s an even worse outcome, so we’ll keep putting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/eff-access-now-and-white-house-sat-down-talk-about-encryption-details&quot;&gt;pressure on the administration in 2016&lt;/a&gt; to publicly disavow this approach and come out with the unequivocal defense of encryption the petition asked for in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Few Bright Spots, Lots of Dark Corners in Corporate Security Practices: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/few-bright-spots-lots-dark-corners-corporate-security-practices-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Corporations that make digital devices and software used by millions around the world for work, play and school had a spotty record of protecting that data in 2015. Because companies are responsible for safeguarding intensely private customer information, it’s important that companies do better. There were bright spots—in June our annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2015&quot;&gt;Who Has Your Back?&lt;/a&gt;  report showed that many major technology companies are adopting best practices around transparency and protecting user data when the government comes knocking. Over one-third of the companies we ranked, including Apple, Dropbox and Yahoo, earned stars in every category we rank—an encouraging sign.  When we launched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2011&quot;&gt;first report&lt;/a&gt; in 2011, no companies had achieved that performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet we still see poor practices among major companies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/verizon-and-turn-break-browser-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/eff-claims-government-spying-atts-help-further-confirmed-new-york-times-article&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/superfish-20-now-dell-breaking-https&quot;&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; and others. Massive data breaches continued to erode customer confidence in privacy protection. Irresponsible companies caused massive security catastrophes and loss of personal data. News broke in February that Lenovo had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/further-evidence-lenovo-breaking-https-security-its-laptops&quot;&gt;shipping laptops&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/02/19/lenovo-caught-installing-adware-new-computers/&quot;&gt;horrifically dangerous piece of software called Superfish&lt;/a&gt;, which tampers with Windows&#039; cryptographic security to perform man-in-the-middle attacks against users’ browsing to inject ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, the California Public Utilities Commission reached a $33 million &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/comcast-agrees-pay-33-million-data-breach-settlement-leaking-thousands-unlisted&quot;&gt;settlement with Comcast&lt;/a&gt; for disseminating the private information of nearly 75,000 customers. According to the CPUC, the company sent all of its telephone subscriber information, including unpublished phone numbers, to a company it had chosen to license and sell subscriber listings. Comcast failed to put a “privacy flag” on the unpublished numbers, which were subsequently distributed to at least one national directory assistance operator and published online where they became available to other data brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, Chinese security researchers discovered that an Android software library developed by the Chinese search giant Baidu was capable of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/millions-android-devices-vulnerable-remote-hijacking-baidu-wrote-code-google-made&quot;&gt;allowing attackers&lt;/a&gt; to remotely wreak havoc on phones, from sending fake SMS messages to downloading arbitrary files or installing apps without user authorization. Baidu had apparently built the capability into the software to remotely upload files, install apps, and trigger all sorts of other actions, leaving as many as 100 million Android devices at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things got worse as the year wore on. In a sad case of déjà vu, we learned in November that Dell had done the same thing as Lenovo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/superfish-20-now-dell-breaking-https&quot;&gt;shipping laptops&lt;/a&gt; pre-installed with an HTTPS root certificate that could allow malicious software or an attacker to impersonate Google, your bank, or any other website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the most troubling cases of privacy failure were facts uncovered by EFF during work on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/student-privacy&quot;&gt;“Spying on Students”&lt;/a&gt; project, which calls attention to the privacy risks of technology supplied to schools by companies like Google. EFF revealed that Google configures Chromebooks used in schools around the country to allow tracking of students’ Internet searches, passwords, and other private information, despite having promised not to. EFF filed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/google-deceptively-tracks-students-internet-browsing-eff-says-complaint-federal-trade&quot;&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Trade Commission seeking an investigation and an order halting Google’s deceptive practices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Return of the Patent Troll: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/return-patent-troll-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As another year goes by without action from Congress, patent trolls have returned in record numbers. The first half of 2015 saw an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/deep-dive-why-we-need-venue-reform-restore-fairness-patent-litigation&quot;&gt;unprecedented number of patents suits&lt;/a&gt;, with most of the growth fueled by patent trolls filing in the Eastern District of Texas. If there is any lesson from this year, it is that the patent troll problem is increasingly localized to one troll-friendly federal district. Any comprehensive patent reform effort will need to address this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of action in Congress was 2015’s biggest disappointment. House and Senate committees both managed to pass &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/senate-gets-serious-about-patent-reform-patent-act&quot;&gt;reasonable bills&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reducing litigation abuse by patent trolls. Meanwhile, opponents of reform tried to muddy the waters by introducing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/strong-patent-act-prime-example-weak-reform&quot;&gt;terrible bill&lt;/a&gt; that would make it even harder to challenge bad patents at the Patent Office. In the end, legislative reform efforts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/patent-reform-under-attack-needed-more-ever&quot;&gt;stalled&lt;/a&gt; over the summer and Congress did nothing. Lawmakers might &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/policy/technology/overnights/262718-overnight-tech-chairman-says-patent-reform-all-about-timing&quot;&gt;return to the issue&lt;/a&gt; before the next election. With trolls running rampant, we need legislative reform now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we did not see blockbuster Supreme Court patent decisions like last year, there was some progress in the courts. Most importantly, the lower courts have applied the 2014 ruling in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/bad-day-bad-patents-supreme-court-unanimously-strikes-down-abstract-software&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alice v. CLS Bank&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;(which held that abstract ideas do not become patentable simply because they are implemented on generic computers) to invalidate a significant number of abstract software patents. The outlier, of course, is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/judges-texas-unfairly-impose-new-requirements-patent-defendants&quot;&gt;Eastern District of Texas&lt;/a&gt; which is granting motions based on &lt;i&gt;Alice &lt;/i&gt;at &lt;a href=&quot;http://docketreport.blogspot.com/2015/08/txed-rejects-73-of-35-usc-101-pretrial.html&quot;&gt;much lower rates&lt;/a&gt; than other courts. This has created an even greater incentive for trolls to flock to that district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the many cases where we participated as amicus curiae, two important Federal Circuit cases stand out. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/federal-circuit-strikes-its-own-blow-against-overbroad-software-patents&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Williamson v. Citrix&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Federal Circuit overruled some ill-advised case law that has been one of the primary drivers of overbroad software patents. Under the new rule, when patent owners claim functionally (i.e. claiming what a invention does, rather than how it does it) there will be more limits on the scope of their patent. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/federal-circuit-confirms-obscure-trade-court-cannot-regulate-internet&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;ClearCorrect v. ITC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Federal Circuit held that the International Trade Commission, an executive agency trade court, does not have the ability to block purely digital goods at the border. This was an important win for the open Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At EFF, we had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-busts-podcasting-patent-invalidating-key-claims-patent-office&quot;&gt;big win&lt;/a&gt; in our challenge to the podcasting patent owned by a patent troll. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board agreed to throw out all of the claims we challenged. That case is currently on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/podcasting-update-personal-audio-files-appeal&quot;&gt;appeal&lt;/a&gt; before the Federal Circuit with a decision likely next near. We also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/victory-photo-hobbyist-prevails-over-junk-patent-bully&quot;&gt;won a case&lt;/a&gt; against a patent owner who had sued a photo hobbyist for running an online photo competition. In that case, the troll abandoned its claims to avoid having the judge rule on whether its patent is valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/stupid-patent-month&quot;&gt;Stupid Patent of the Month&lt;/a&gt; series highlighting the kinds of terrible software patents that get wielded by trolls. And we filed a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/eff-public-knowledge-file-comments-help-fix-patent-office&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; with the Patent Office urging it to more diligently apply &lt;i&gt;Alice &lt;/i&gt;and to stop issuing so many bad patents. Next year, we’ll be back fighting in the courts, before Congress, and at the Patent Office to bring fairness and sanity to the patent system. While we had some wins in 2015, patent trolls continue to run rampant and much more needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EFF Joins ACLU in Amicus Brief Supporting Warrant Requirement for Cell-Site Simulators</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/eff-joins-aclu-amicus-brief-supporting-warrant-requirement-cell-site-simulators</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFF, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/maryland-court-considering-key-question-legality-stingray-use&quot;&gt;ACLU, and ACLU of Maryland&lt;/a&gt; filed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/state-maryland-v-andrews-effaclu-amicus-brief-stingrays&quot;&gt;amicus brief&lt;/a&gt; today in the Maryland Court of Special Appeals in the first case in the country (that we know of) where a judge has thrown out evidence obtained as a result of using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/sls/tech/cell-site-simulators&quot;&gt;cell-site simulator&lt;/a&gt; without a warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case, Baltimore Police used a Hailstorm—a cell-site simulator from the same company that makes &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/meet-the-machines-that-steal-your-phones-data/&quot;&gt;Stingrays&lt;/a&gt;—to locate Kerron Andrews, the defendant. The police not only failed to get a warrant to use the device, they also failed to disclose it to the judge in their &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/state-maryland-v-andrews-application-pentrap-order&quot;&gt;application for a pen register order&lt;/a&gt;. And it appears they even &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/state-maryland-v-andrews-june-trial-court-transcript&quot;&gt;failed to tell the State’s attorney&lt;/a&gt; prosecuting Mr. Andrews’ case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily Mr. Andrews’ intrepid defense attorney suspected the police might have used a stingray and sent a discovery request asking specifically if they had. The prosecution stalled for months on answering that request, but, on the eve of trial, one of the investigators responsible for Baltimore PD’s stingrays finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/state-maryland-v-andrews-june-trial-court-transcript&quot;&gt;testified &lt;/a&gt;in court not only that he&#039;d used the device to find Mr. Andrews, but that he’d specifically not disclosed it in any report filed about Andrews’ arrest. The judge concluded the police had intentionally withheld information from Mr. Andrews—a clear violation of his constitutional rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This August, another Baltimore judge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/state-maryland-v-andrews-august-trial-court-transcript&quot;&gt;granted &lt;/a&gt;the defense’s request to suppress all evidence the police were able to get as a direct result of using the stingray. The judge held the use of the device without a warrant violated Andrews’ Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures. Unsurprisingly, the government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/state-maryland-v-andrews-marylands-opening-appellate-brief&quot;&gt;appealed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/sls/tech/cell-site-simulators&quot;&gt;Cell-site simulators&lt;/a&gt;, also commonly known as IMSI catchers or stingrays, masquerade as legitimate cell phone towers, tricking phones nearby into connecting to the device instead of the tower operated by the phone company. This allows police to log the identifying numbers of mobile phones in the area and to pinpoint their locations. Police often use cell-site simulators when they are trying to find a suspect and know his phone&#039;s identifying information.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we learned from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/08/23/baltimore-police-stingray-cell-surveillance/31994181/&quot;&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;, the Baltimore PD has been using cell-site simulators extensively (and secretly) for at least the last eight years. A detective testified that Baltimore officers had used cell-site simulators more than 4,300 times since 2007. Like other law enforcement agencies around the country, Baltimore has used its devices for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/08/23/baltimore-police-stingray-cell-surveillance/31994181/&quot;&gt;major and minor crimes&lt;/a&gt;—everything from trying to locate a man who had kidnapped two small children to trying to find another man who took his wife’s cellphone during an argument (and later returned it). And, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article25894096.html&quot;&gt;other law enforcement agencies&lt;/a&gt;, the Baltimore PD has regularly withheld information about Stingrays from defense attorneys, judges, and the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stingrays are especially pernicious surveillance tools because they collect information on every single phone in a given area—not just the suspect’s phone—this means they allow the police to conduct indiscriminate, dragnet searches. They are also able to locate people inside traditionally-protected private spaces like homes, doctors’ offices, or places of worship—in Mr. Andrews’ case the investigators used the Stingray to pinpoint his location to within a specific apartment. Stingrays can also be configured to capture the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal/legacy/2014/10/29/elec-sur-manual.pdf&quot;&gt;content of communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why it&#039;s imperative that police not only obtain a warrant based on probable cause before using a cell-site simulator but also commit to minimization procedures, including immediately deleting information about all phones not covered by the warrant and limiting the time period during which the device is used. These are not novel or onerous requirements—the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ilt.eff.org/index.php/Privacy:_Wiretap_Act&quot;&gt;Wiretap Act&lt;/a&gt; requires similar procedures. And in fact, both the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justice.gov/opa/file/767321/download&quot;&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Department%20Policy%20Regarding%20the%20Use%20of%20Cell-Site%20Simulator%20Technology.pdf&quot;&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; recently committed to following similar procedures whenever their agents use stingrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope the Maryland Court of Special Appeals will agree that the warrantless use of a stingray is unconstitutional and uphold the lower court ruling suppressing the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Human Research Loopholes: Alive and Well</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/human-research-loopholes-alive-and-well</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of the darkest chapters in medical ethics, the United States government ran an experiment from the 1930s to the 1970s in which it withheld treatment and medical information from rural African-American men suffering from syphilis. The public uproar generated by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm&quot;&gt;Tuskegee Syphilis Study&lt;/a&gt; eventually resulted in regulations restricting government-supported research testing on humans. These regulations are called the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/commonrule/&quot;&gt;Common Rule&lt;/a&gt;,” and they are right now up for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-09-08/pdf/2015-21756.pdf&quot;&gt;first full update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  Common Rule, also known as the &quot;Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects,&quot; is supposed to affirmatively protect us from the abuses of the future. However, the proposed regulation is lousy with loopholes, including ones that could exempt tracking online behavior and experiments related to intelligence activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;File a comment on the “Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects” through &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regulations.gov/#!submitComment;D=HHS-OPHS-2015-0008-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Regulations.gov&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the Common Rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Common Rule was created in 1991 as an outgrowth of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.html&quot;&gt;Belmont Report&lt;/a&gt;, a series of ethical and principles and guidelines created by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research to address issues raised by the Tuskegee experiment. The Common Rule claims to strike a balance between the three goals identified in the Belmont Report: 1) respecting persons, 2) ‘beneficence’ (&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;maximizing the social value of science and research), and 3) justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This federal policy purportedly binds the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and numerous other agencies, including the CIA and Department of Homeland Security (per &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/primer-executive-order-12333-mass-surveillance-starlet&quot;&gt;Executive Order 12333&lt;/a&gt;). But as we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/torturingdemocracy/documents/20020801-1.pdf&quot;&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt;, these agencies are &lt;a href=&quot;https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/NSA/law_prof_response.pdf&quot;&gt;adept&lt;/a&gt; at honing in on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/foia/foia-secret-surveillance-law-memo&quot;&gt;small loopholes&lt;/a&gt;, so the proposed language needs a serious edit if it is going to provide any real protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF filed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dataprivacylab.org/projects/irb/EFF.pdf&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; when HHS first proposed this update in 2011, and we are drafting a new comment laying out our biggest concerns to file by January 6, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Biospecimen Consent Loophole&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most glaring problem in the proposed rule is its weak update of the ethical practices around biospecimens or biological samples—such as blood, toenails, or DNA—taken from human beings. The proposed rule requires only “broad consent” before researchers can exempt secondary research (research done on leftover biospecimen after the initial purpose for the draw is complete) from review by independent ethics boards. This kind of ‘consent’ is almost no consent at all: it doesn’t let human subjects know what the future biospecimen research entails, how it will affect them, or how the biospecimen or research data will be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These specimens contain DNA that are more likely to be identifiable given the rise of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/fbis-next-generation-identification-database&quot;&gt;genetic databases&lt;/a&gt;.  While genomic-related research and technology is of great potential benefit, its rapid evolution also presents significant risk and uncertainty to privacy and social control, especially given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/12/rapid-dna-analysis&quot;&gt;increasing use&lt;/a&gt; by law enforcement and government of genetic identification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &quot;Public&quot; Behavior Loophole&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also concerned that the rule proposes an ethics-review exemption for all studies collecting “public behavior” as long as that information is “uninfluenced by the investigators” and properly anonymized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first place, this places too much trust in the benefits of what currently qualifies as “anonymization.” Traditional de-identification techniques are often no match for modern data analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the Common Rule cannot be considered a modern ethical standard if it potentially leaves sensitive Internet traffic beyond protection merely because it is not occurring in a single “private” physical place in one person’s home. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-files-22-firsthand-accounts-how-nsa-surveillance-chilled-right-association&quot;&gt;Knowing what we know&lt;/a&gt; about the impact of tracking who gathers where, and with whom they communicate—it is inexcusable to ignore the danger of creating language flexible enough to risk entirely exempting this subject matter from review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Intelligence Surveillance Activities Loophole&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, HHS proposes absolute ethics-review exemptions for “intelligence surveillance activities.” This would exempt actions “conducted to fulfill a department or agency’s legal mandate to ensure the safety and protection of the United States, its people, and its national security interests.” The government is professing to fence DHS and the CIA in through E.O. 12333, but they’re actually building in a gaping breach for them to stroll right back out through.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/national-security-and-medical-information&quot;&gt;Existing law&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/medical-privacy/glossary#Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act_HIPAA&quot;&gt;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/medical-privacy/glossary#Privacy_Rule&quot;&gt;Privacy Rule&lt;/a&gt; already includes a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title45-vol1/pdf/CFR-2011-title45-vol1-sec164-512.pdf&quot;&gt;national security exception&lt;/a&gt; that permits doctors, hospitals, and any other &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/medical-privacy/glossary#Covered_Entity&quot;&gt;covered entity&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to disclose individual health information &quot;to authorized federal officials for the conduct of lawful intelligence, counter-intelligence, and other national security activities authorized by the National Security Act.&quot; But this is an exemption that needs to be patched over, not replicated.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deadline Approaches &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These loopholes discussed above are just a sample of many we hope to force HHS to reckon with when we file our comments by January 6, 2016. Please join us in respecting the memories of those abused by human subject research in the past by filing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regulations.gov/#!submitComment;D=HHS-OPHS-2015-0008-0001&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; of your own. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stupid Patent of the Month: Microsoft’s Design Patent on a Slider</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/stupid-patent-month-microsofts-design-patent-slider</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, this month’s Stupid Patent of the Month is being awarded to a design patent. Microsoft recently sued Corel for, among other things, infringing its patent on a slider, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2015/12/28/patd554140.pdf&quot;&gt;D554,140&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that Corel Home Office has infringed Microsoft’s design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design patent, as detailed by Microsoft in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2015/12/28/microsoft_v_corel_-_complaint.pdf&quot;&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt;, is titled “User Interface for a Portion of a Display Screen” and entitles Microsoft to own this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/28/microsoft_slider.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-center&quot; height=&quot;146&quot; width=&quot;626&quot; p=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, Microsoft claims to own this design of a slider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design patents aren’t like the utility patents that most people think of when they think of patents. Unlike utility patents, which are meant for new and useful inventions, design patents are meant for new, non-functional, ornamental aspects of articles. They have only one claim, little to no written description, and usually a series of images detailing what exactly is being claimed. (A note &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s1503.html&quot;&gt;about design patents&lt;/a&gt;: solid lines are used to show what is claimed; broken or dotted lines show the unclaimed “environment related to the design” or define the boundary of the design.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Professor Sarah Burstein points out on her fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;http://design-law.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, design patents are often issued on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://design-law.tumblr.com/post/131710353101/issued-this-week-to-appled741316&quot;&gt;small part&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://design-law.tumblr.com/post/88699080466/issued-this-week-to-googled706-791-for-a&quot;&gt;product&lt;/a&gt;, and often for &lt;a href=&quot;http://design-law.tumblr.com/post/67759369389/seriously-issued-this-weeka-design-patent-for-a&quot;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; that seem &lt;a href=&quot;http://design-law.tumblr.com/post/67760049201/seriously-issued-this-week-to-beifa-group-co&quot;&gt;unoriginal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://design-law.tumblr.com/post/102606756496/issued-this-week-to-hagihara-industries&quot;&gt;not ornamental&lt;/a&gt;, or just &lt;a href=&quot;http://design-law.tumblr.com/post/131172725371/issued-this-week-to-the-quaker-oats&quot;&gt;ridiculous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s patent claims against Corel are unsurprising in light of how much money is potentially at stake. If Corel is found to infringe even one of Microsoft’s design patents through even the smallest part of Corel Home Office, current Federal Circuit law entitles Microsoft to &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of Corel’s profits for the entire product. Not the profits that can be attributed to the design. Not the value that the design adds to a product. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;All &lt;/i&gt;of the profit from Corel Home Office.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-known &lt;i&gt;Apple v. Samsung &lt;/i&gt;dispute addressed the issue of whether an infringer should be required to pay all of its profits for infringing a design patent that applies only to a portion of a product. Samsung had asked the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to reject this reading, but the court disagreed in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/14-1335.Opinion.5-14-2015.1.PDF&quot;&gt;May, 2015 opinion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung has now asked the Supreme Court to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2015/12/28/samsung-petition-12-14-15.pdf&quot;&gt;weigh in&lt;/a&gt;. In its petition for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certiorari&quot;&gt;certiorari&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung points out the absurd results of this rule. For example, Samsung explains that under the Federal Circuit’s ruling, “profits on an entire car—or even an eighteen-wheel tractor trailer—must be awarded based on an undetachable infringing cup-holder.” In addition, given that many products will include multiple ornamental features that could be covered by design patents, this raises the possibility that a company could get hit for multiple judgments for all its profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;image-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2014/07/30/stupid-patent-square-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right image-left&quot; height=&quot;237&quot; width=&quot;237&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds pretty crazy to us. But that’s exactly what might happen if Microsoft prevails against Corel. Putting aside whether Microsoft’s design was actually new and not obvious in 2006 (when Microsoft filed its application), whether Microsoft needed the patent incentive in order to come up with this design, and whether it is even desirable to grant a company a government-backed monopoly on a graphical slider (we don&#039;t think so, that&#039;s why this is a stupid patent), the scope of damages for design patent infringement has the potential to become a powerful tool to shut down legitimate competition based on the mere threat of a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Defending Prisoner Rights in the Digital World: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/defending-prisoner-rights-digital-world-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;From a cell in a South Carolina prison, seven inmates filmed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wbqiSVLUq8&quot;&gt;a rap video&lt;/a&gt; on a cell phone and uploaded it to a popular hip-hop website. The track, “On Fire,” caught fire online—but the viral clip also caught the attention of prison administrators. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/cjciaramella/these-inmates-got-months-in-solitary-confinement-for-making&quot;&gt;As Buzzfeed reported&lt;/a&gt; using records obtained by EFF under South Carolina’s Freedom of Information Act, the inmates received obscene punishments for expressing themselves: a combined total of nearly 20 years in solitary confinement for accessing social media, using a contraband cell phone, and engaging in gang-related speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Although mass incarceration in the United States is an important issue that most reasonable people believe policymakers must address, prison and jails haven’t historically gotten a lot of attention from digital rights advocates. After all, inmates don’t have access to the Internet, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. That may have been true a decade ago, but now the digital world has extended beyond bars with the growth of social media as a political tool, the rise in availability of contraband smartphones, the introduction of digital communication technologies into detention facilities, and law enforcement’s adoption of facial recognition using mugshots. This issue has come into sharp focus for the Internet freedom community with incarcerated whistleblower &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xychelsea&quot;&gt;Chelsea Manning&lt;/a&gt; launching a Twitter feed and imprisoned journalist &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2015/12/02/barrett-brown-the-government-explains-why-it-took-my-email/&quot;&gt;Barrett Brown&lt;/a&gt; publishing his writing online at various news sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, EFF found the opportunity to use our expertise in free speech, privacy, and intellectual property to defend the rights of 2.2 million people that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sentencingproject.org/template/page.cfm?id=107&quot;&gt;The Sentencing Project&lt;/a&gt; estimates are currently incarcerated in the United States. Our work has also allowed us to reach a new audience with Prison Legal News and San Francisco Bay View republishing our stories and sending them to their incarcerated subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2015/06/04/facebook-10-big.png&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;February&lt;/b&gt;: EFF published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/hundreds-south-carolina-inmates-sent-solitary-confinement-over-facebook&quot;&gt;an explosive report&lt;/a&gt; on how the South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC) treats posting to social media as an offense on par with hostage-taking, rioting, rape, and escape. Hundreds of inmates received extended stints in solitary confinement over social network use, including two inmates who were sentenced to more than 30 years in solitary for accessing Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through public-records requests, EFF learned that SCDC considered each day an inmate accessed social media as a separate offense. For example, if an inmate accessed Facebook once every day in July, that would be 31 separate “Level 1” offenses, each individually earning the inmate a year in solitary confinement—plus additional penalties if the access was conducted with a contraband smartphone or the communication referenced gangs. Now, some form of punishment could arguably be appropriate for inmates possessing contraband phones or engaging in criminal activity, but the sentences for those charges were miniscule in comparison to the stacked charges for logging onto Facebook. In other words, sanctioning an inmate for possessing a smuggled smartphone is more reasonable than punishing the inmate for every communication he made with the contraband device, regardless of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is crucial to note that inmates were punished severely even when they didn’t possess a phone and were simply having their friends and families operate their accounts on their behalves and engaging in benign communications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of uncovering these abuses, we also discovered that Facebook had created a special “Inmate Account Takedown Request” system for corrections departments and was systematically suspending inmate accounts without first confirming that the inmates’ activities violated its community standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scandal spread across the news media, and SCDC subsequently announced it would stop piling up social media punishments. In response to unrelated litigation, SCDC also said it would cap solitary confinement at 60 days. While we believe that is still too harsh a punishment for social media offenses, we’re happy to see that SCDC has begun to reform its practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;April: &lt;/b&gt;After learning about SCDC’s harsh treatment of prisoners, EFF, the ACLU’s National Prison Project, and journalist and anti-solitary-confinement activist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/04/facebook-now-a-place-for-prisoners-too.html&quot;&gt;Sarah Shourd&lt;/a&gt; began looking at Alabama. A state law criminalized inmate access to social media (defined so broadly that it could apply to any website) and made it a misdemeanor to even access the Internet on an inmate’s behalf. Among the most heinous cases we discovered was a mother on a work furlough who was punished for logging onto Facebook to view her children’s Easter photos and an inmate who administered a “Free Alabama Movement” Facebook page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/what-if-mlks-letter-birmingham-city-jail-had-been-facebook-post&quot;&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt; on the 52&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous ““Letter from Birmingham Jail,” we called out the state of Alabama for creating a law that, had King written it today, would have made it a crime for anyone to share King’s influential words on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;May: &lt;/b&gt;Many prisons have adopted secure video and email systems that allow inmates to communicate digitally with their friends and family outside. One inmate in Indiana, however, was severely punished after his sister posted a video he had sent through the prison’s “videogram” system to a Facebook page she created to promote his innocence campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His offense: allegedly violating the vendor JPay’s intellectual property rights. As it turned out, buried in the contractor’s terms of service was a clause asserting that JPay “owns all of the content, including any text, data, information, images, or other material, that you transmit through the Service.” By that standard, if an inmate sent a poem to his mother, or a child sent a drawing to his incarcerated parent, JPay could claim exclusive ownership of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days after EFF &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/hidden-cost-jpays-prison-email-system&quot;&gt;publicized&lt;/a&gt; this outrageous clause, JPay (which had recently been acquired by Securus) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/jpay-will-no-longer-claim-ownership-over-inmate-family-correspondence&quot;&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it would remove it from its Terms of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;June: &lt;/b&gt;Over the course of six months, EFF engaged in extensive negotiations with Facebook over its inmate takedown policy and obtained documents from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation that contradicted how Facebook said it processed inmate takedown requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, EFF and The Daily Beast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/facebook-reforms-inmate-account-takedown-process&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook would no longer suspend inmate pages no-questions-asked. Instead, it would require prison officials to either show that the law in their state explicitly forbids inmate access to social media or demonstrate how an inmate’s behavior online presents a genuine “serious safety risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that was a positive step, EFF had another problem with Facebook: it was not reporting requests from prisons as part of its annual “Government Request Report.” Consequently, we gave Facebook a failing grade in the censorship portion of our annual “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2015&quot;&gt;Who Has Your Back?&lt;/a&gt;” report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September: &lt;/strong&gt;EFF joined the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial Counties, the Cato Institute, the Brechner First Amendment Project, and the First Amendment Coalition in an amicus brief defending the free speech rights on people on supervised release from prison. In the case, an ex-offender&#039;s probation was revoked because he criticized a law enforcement officer in a blog post. The government claimed that he had violated the terms of his release, which instructed him not to “harass” anyone else, including “defaming a person’s character on the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, we received &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/internet-free-speech-people-supervised-release-prison&quot;&gt;good news&lt;/a&gt; in the case. As EFF Senior Staff Attorney Adam Schwartz writes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]he government’s response to the amicus brief made several significant concessions. First, the government acknowledged that a release condition against “harassment” must be limited to situations where the parolee actually intends to harass someone. Second, the government recognized that harassment does not occur when a parolee merely posts a complaint about police brutality on a message board, writes a negative Yelp review, or publishes an essay criticizing the criminal justice system. Third, the government conceded that the release condition against “defaming” someone else only applies to situations where there is harassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November&lt;/strong&gt;: EFF awarded a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/stupid-patent-month-infamous-prison-telco-patents-asking-third-parties-money&quot;&gt;Stupid Patent of the Month&lt;/a&gt; honoring prison-phone vendor Securus for its patented method of “proactively establishing a third-party payment account,&quot; i.e. robocalling a family member to ask if they are willing to set up a pre-paid phone account for a family member booked into a local jail. As EFF&#039;s Mark Cuban Chair to Eliminate Stupid Patents Daniel Nazer wrote: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two serious problems with this patent. First, the claims are directed to a mind-numbingly mundane business practice and should have been rejected as obvious. Obvious uses or combinations of existing technology are not patentable. Second, the claims are ineligible for patent protection under the Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/bad-day-bad-patents-supreme-court-unanimously-strikes-down-abstract-software&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alice v. CLS Bank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—this is a recent Supreme Court decision that holds that an abstract idea (like contacting potential third-party payers) doesn’t become eligible for a patent simply because it is implemented using generic technology. That the system failed to register either of these defects shows deep dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sane world, a patent examiner would apply common sense and reject Securus’ application out of hand. It includes no technological innovation (it notes that all of the relevant phone technology already exists); instead, it simply describes a basic set of steps for contacting potential third-party payers. Unfortunately, the Federal Circuit has essentially beaten common sense out of the patent system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking ahead &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming New Year, EFF will continue to examine issues related to incarceration and advocate for the rights of inmates. For one, we are currently working with MuckRock News to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/help-us-map-police-use-mobile-biometric-technology&quot;&gt;survey how&lt;/a&gt; local law enforcement agencies are using facial recognition and other biometric technologies in the field. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/how-california-cops-use-mobile-biometric-tech-field&quot;&gt;One thing&lt;/a&gt; we’ve learned so far is that often the primary source of this biometric data is county jails, where inmates are photographed and fingerprinted during the booking process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also keeping a close eye on the Federal Communications Commission, which is considering regulations for how prisons adopt digital communications technologies, such as video visitation and inmate email, to ensure that prisoners and their families aren’t gouged by unfair pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, a federal judge invalidated Pennsylvania’s Revictimization Relief Act, which allows crime victims to sue inmates who engage in “conduct which perpetuates the continuing effect of the crime on the victim,” including online speech. As Chief Judge Christopher Conner wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/mumia-abu-jamal-v-kathleen-kane-memorandum&quot;&gt;the opinion&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A past criminal offense does not extinguish the offender’s constitutional right to free expression. The First Amendment does not evanesce at the prison gate, and its enduring guarantee of freedom of speech subsumes the right to expressive conduct that some may find offensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t agree more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reforms Abound for Cross-Border Data Requests </title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/reforms-abound-cross-border-data-requests</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to data stored in the United States presents an especially important question for other countries because of the prominence of U.S. Internet companies. Currently, law enforcement officials in other countries must pursue access to data in the U.S. through the Department of Justice (DOJ)-run Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_legal_assistance_treaty&quot;&gt;MLAT&lt;/a&gt;) process, which has been rightly criticized as slow and inefficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, academics Jennifer Daskal and Andrew Woods have focused the discussion on the issue by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justsecurity.org/27857/cross-border-data-requests-proposed-framework/&quot;&gt;proposing&lt;/a&gt; a new U.S. legal regime. The proposal contains important ideas, and we&#039;re thankful for concrete thoughts around lawful access to data; however, it doesn&#039;t address what we view as the actual solution: reforming the MLAT process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Need MLAT Reform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A serious attempt to reform the MLAT process must happen before we create yet another legal regime for access to data stored outside a country&#039;s border. Such reform is necessary because the MLAT process is a system that ensures privacy, protects users, and requires countries seeking messages to abide by one of the highest legal standards (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause&quot;&gt;probable cause&lt;/a&gt;) in the world. It also needs reform because a foreign law enforcement officer should not have to wait anywhere between 6-13 months—the current time frame for receiving data through an MLAT request—for data necessary to her local investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MLAT reform goes beyond adding more funds or staff. It involves training and co-operation between law enforcement so that their work can meet the probable cause standard to expedite their request. And it may require restructuring key offices at the Justice Department to facilitate faster responses. The DOJ must make a good-faith attempt to prioritize such changes and commit to finding solutions in the literature about how to reform the MLAT process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How the Alternative Proposal Works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Stored Communications Act (SCA), U.S. providers may not disclose stored communications content to anyone (including foreign governments) unless an exception applies, such as user consent or a warrant based on probable cause. Daskal and Woods &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justsecurity.org/27857/cross-border-data-requests-proposed-framework/&quot;&gt;propose&lt;/a&gt; an interesting alternative to the MLAT process by amending the SCA so that U.S.-based companies can respond directly to foreign government requests for stored data. The foreign government must state that the data belongs to a non-U.S. person located outside the United States and that the data is relevant and material to the crime at hand. Under the Daskal and Woods’ proposal, only countries that follow certain human rights standards will be able to use this alternative track. Daskal and Woods contemplate that this arrangement will be reciprocal: the United States would be able to directly receive data from a foreign-based provider under analogous rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elimination of U.S. Probable Cause and the Creation of a Two-Tier World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Daskal-Woods proposal suffers from two principal flaws: it appears to lower the current legal standard for accessing data within the United States, and then applies that lower standard to a subset of the world&#039;s Internet users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, all countries must meet the U.S. legal standard of probable cause before obtaining communications from U.S.-based companies. The proposal seems to lower this standard by mandating requests be &quot;relevant and material&quot; to the crime under investigation. While it’s our understanding that the proposed language is meant to approximate the U.S. probable cause standard without using the words “probable cause,” the elasticity of “relevance” (as seen in U.S. debates over the scope of Section 215) is a red flag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t doubt that the global popularity of U.S.-based services has sharply increased the volume or scale of cross-border data requests from foreign governments, and we recognize that foreign governments are placing tremendous pressure on U.S. providers to accede to these requests, but the United States should not lower its legal standards as a result. When it functions properly, the current MLAT regime ensures users everywhere are given probable cause protection for access to their messages if they choose to store them with U.S. companies. The popularity of American Internet companies means the U.S. can export more protective legal standards for access to personal data around the world. This is a badge to be worn proudly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second knotty aspect of the Daskal-Woods proposal is for a human rights assessment of a country before accepting it into this proposed regime. That might be an understandable trade-off, if such a balancing act could be objectively and independently determined. At present, we’ve yet to see how that could be done. We fear that a real-world implementation would inevitably pass control of such a whitelist to the U.S. executive branch, which has its own interests in rewarding and punishing foreign nations—distinct from users’ interests in privacy and civil liberties. Our caution about a previous attempt (the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/global-online-freedom-act&quot;&gt; Global Online Freedom Act&lt;/a&gt;) to divide the world into “good” and “bad” Internet nations makes us skeptical that the criteria would remain truly objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s also an outstanding question as to what the United States would think of such a proposal if roles were reversed. For example, assuming that a country&#039;s human rights record should relate to local law enforcement access to data, would the U.S. detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay or disclosures found in the recently declassified &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Intelligence_Committee_report_on_CIA_torture&quot;&gt;Torture Report&lt;/a&gt; be able to pass another country&#039;s human rights assessment? Countries with high standards of human rights often fail to live up to those standards within a particular prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.necessaryandproportionate.org/text#principle_12&quot;&gt;Necessary and Proportionate Principles&lt;/a&gt; are useful when analyzing proposals like the one offered by Daskal and Woods. The Necessary and Proportionate Principles declare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) and other agreements entered into by States should ensure that, where the laws of more than one state could apply to Communications Surveillance, the available standard with the higher level of protection for individuals is applied… States may not use mutual legal assistance processes and foreign requests for Protected Information to circumvent domestic legal restrictions on Communications Surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Daskal-Woods proposal does not require the functional equivalent of probable cause (combined with “particularity” requirements), it would offer certain foreign countries a lower standard of access for communications content than is available to U.S. law enforcement. Privacy reforms should aspire to the highest standard, applied in a non-discriminatory fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Components to Any Legal Regime&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal catalyzes important questions for countries’ access to data outside their borders. We think any proposal must account for scenarios where a foreign data request may involve U.S. citizen data, since U.S. persons’ Fourth Amendment rights should be accounted for in any legal regime. Similarly, a proposal should also include a notice provision, or at least contemplate how the Fourth Amendment&#039;s notice requirements may interact with the new legal regime. There&#039;s no doubt that a target—and people communicating with the target—should be notified of a governmental search. And it remains unclear to us how users whose communications are collected by foreign governments can hold those foreign governments accountable for rights violations.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reform is Real, but MLAT Problems Must Be Solved First&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to reform how foreign countries can access data held by U.S. companies is real. U.S. companies are feeling tremendous pressure from countries expressing frustration that they cannot obtain evidence in a timely fashion from U.S. companies. Some fear that the inability to back a reform proposal may create a race to the bottom where countries will demand that personal data be kept locally, where it may be reached with lower legal standards than America&#039;s probable cause standard. We are sympathetic towards such arguments, but such threats do not necessitate the creation of an entirely new regime for lawful access. Many countries that are threatening localization requirements will continue these threats under a new regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not trade away the best elements of the current system—its high legal standard—in an effort to head off such threats. Instead, we should identify serious proposals for MLAT reform and fix the current system for everyone before creating yet another—potentially flawed—legal regime for the few. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What Happened With Crypto This Year? 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/technical-crypto-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Under the glare of the modern surveillance state, EFF&#039;s long-held goal of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/encrypt-the-web&quot;&gt;encrypting the web&lt;/a&gt; has only grown more pressing. And crypto remains on the march, with promising developments ranging from the public beta launch of the Let&#039;s Encrypt project, to the expansion of CloudFlare&#039;s Universal SSL program, or the Facebook announcement of PGP-encrypted notifications. But there&#039;s also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/encryption-balance-2015-review&quot;&gt;misguided chatter&lt;/a&gt; from law enforcement and elected officials, calling to weaken that crypto with backdoors, “golden keys,” and other efforts to undermine security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the technical developments of this past year can help us understand why those calls are so fundamentally misguided. And while 2015 may not have been the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/12/three-vulnerabilities-rocked-online-security-world-2014-review&quot;&gt;banner year that 2014&lt;/a&gt; was in terms of attacks (with Heartbleed and POODLE), there were still a number of interesting developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When Our Computers Trust Somebody That &lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; Don&#039;t&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two PC manufacturers were busted inserting a “trusted root certificate” onto the computers they sell, undermining user security in order to inject ads into web pages. Both faced major backlash, and we hope they&#039;ve learned from these disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Lenovo was found out earlier this year to be shipping its laptops installed with a piece of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/%5Ch&quot;&gt;pre-installed junkware called “Superfish”&lt;/a&gt; which installed a custom root certificate to enable the software to man-in-the-middle HTTPS connections to inject advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being creepy and inappropriate, this approach introduced a devastating security vulnerability as it was easy for anybody to extract the root certificate&#039;s private key and then (with some mild trickery) man-in-the-middle HTTPS connections to most external sites. EFF was able to confirm that several thousand Superfish-signed certificates were seen in the wild using data from our Decentralized SSL Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the ensuing controversy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/%5Ch&quot;&gt;Dell was caught in November doing essentially the same thing&lt;/a&gt;. On the plus side, while Lenovo initially dragged its feet to recognize the severity of Superfish, Dell quickly issued an apology and a tool to remove the offending certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Export-Grade “Security” Proves Insecure, Again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls for deliberately weakened encryption seem to overlook the fact that we are less secure even &lt;i&gt;today&lt;/i&gt; as we deal with the reverberations of the 1990s-era “Crypto Wars,” and official decisions to limit the security of crypto software around the world. The most significant practical cryptanalytic attack of 2015 took advantage of that insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 20, a group of 14 security researchers published a paper titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy-ccs15.pdf&quot;&gt;Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice&lt;/a&gt; describing an attack targeting Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange as used by HTTPS, SSH, VPN and other servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was really two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/logjam-internet-breaks-again&quot;&gt;distinct&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/logjam-part-2-did-nsa-know-years-internet-was-broken&quot;&gt;vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;. The first, against 512-bit DH parameters, was demonstrated by the research team itself using consumer-grade hardware and affects many servers still in deployment in 2015 (many of which have seen been patched, but not all). This is the attack that, like last year&#039;s FREAK, relies on the continued use of &quot;export grade&quot; ciphersuites in many TLS deployments. “Export grade” ciphersuites are, of course, a relic of law enforcement limiting the export of strong encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second Logjam attack, against 1024-bit DH parameters, was estimated by the researchers to be just within the resources of a nation-state attacker (read: NSA) to perform. It relies on the fact that breaking discrete-log in a 1024-bit DH group requires significant pre-computation which is specific to the prime in use, but this can amortized by attacking many servers using the same prime. By analyzing the NSA &#039;black budget,&#039; they went one step further, showing that it is at least possible if not likely that the NSA has been performing this attack for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the past, the insecurity discovered here a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/how-to-protect-yourself-from-nsa-attacks-1024-bit-DH&quot;&gt;pain to clean up&lt;/a&gt;. Major browsers have removed the insecure 512-bit export-grade suites, but the 1024-bit attack remains effective in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Certificate Transparency Catches Symantec&#039;s Screw-ups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security certificates tell our computers who to trust, so a “mis-issuance”—when somebody gets or makes a certificate they&#039;re not supposed to—is a big problem. Fortunately, 2015 was a quiet year for mis-issuance, and the big story comes from a long-awaited protection measure doing its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, Google researchers discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/09/improved-digital-certificate-security.html&quot;&gt;a certificate for google.com&lt;/a&gt; mistakenly issued by Symantec, apparently for &quot;testing&quot; purposes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/symantec-issues-rogue-ev-certificate-googlecom&quot;&gt;Two things were interesting&lt;/a&gt; about this compared to past rogue certificates. First, it was an extended validation (EV) certificate, which are supposed to have a higher standard of checking before issuance. Second, it was perhaps the first major rogue certificate detected by Certificate Transparency logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what CT was designed to achieve and this was a nice validation of years of work to get CT deployed. Further testing revealed that Symantec &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/10/sustaining-digital-certificate-security.html&quot;&gt;mis-issued at least 164 certificates for &quot;testing&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, indicating long-running operational problems. Symantec was hit with an unusual penalty by Google: as of June 2016 all Symantec certificates will have to be included in CT logs to be accepted by Chrome. While the plan has always been for Chrome to eventually require all certificates to be included in a CT log, imposing this on Symantec early is effectively a probationary status. In December, one of Symantec&#039;s root certificates was &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/10/sustaining-digital-certificate-security.html&quot;&gt;also removed from Chrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Backdoor Backfires, in Exploit Built on NSA&#039;s Shaky Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late-breaking news, one of the backdoors discovered in Juniper&#039;s code base this month might be the first non-NSA exploit of the infamous Dual_EC random number generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most pernicious NSA actions revealed by the Snowden leaks was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projectbullrun.org/dual-ec/&quot;&gt;backdoor inserted into the Dual_EC standard&lt;/a&gt;. Unpredictable, random numbers are critical in cryptography for many purposes, including generating secret keys. By picking two constant numbers (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;) in the standard Dual_EC algorithm to have a special relationship (a known discrete logarithm &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;), NSA gained the ability to learn the value of secret keys and other random values generated using the Dual_EC algorithm. Because the secret value &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; is needed to exploit it, this appeared to be a &quot;nobody but us&quot; backdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Juniper (as well as several other companies) &lt;a href=&quot;https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&amp;amp;id=KB28205&amp;amp;pmv=print&amp;amp;actp=LIST&quot;&gt;recognized the risk of using the NSA-recommended &lt;em&gt;P &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and used a different &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; value in its devices. This would still be concerning, as it&#039;s not clear if this gives Juniper (or somebody else) the same backdoor that NSA wanted. However, the backdoor discovered by Juniper last week appears to work by changing &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q &lt;/em&gt;yet again through an &quot;unauthorized code change&quot; to Juniper&#039;s source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, Juniper tried changing they key to NSA&#039;s backdoor (possibly throwing their own key away) and then somebody &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpw.sh/blog/2015/12/21/the-backdoored-backdoor/&quot;&gt;apparently sneakily changed the key yet again&lt;/a&gt;. It appears that, despite Juniper&#039;s purported efforts to hedge against the use of Dual_EC with a second random number generator, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpw.sh/blog/2015/12/21/the-backdoored-backdoor/&quot;&gt;this is an exploitable backdoor&lt;/a&gt; due to bugs in the software (intentional or unintentional). We don&#039;t know who did this or how they inserted the unauthorized code. It could have been NSA itself reclaiming its original backdoor, a foreign intelligence agency, or possibly a criminal organization. Whoever did it had the ability to decrypt all traffic from many Juniper middleboxes for a period of several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the misguided belief that cryptography can be compromised for &quot;nobody but us&quot; appears to have backfired spectacularly. Oh, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2015/12/20/cve-2015-7755-juniper-screenos-authentication-backdoor&quot;&gt;much simpler master SSH password vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; was also inserted into Juniper&#039;s codebase for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Out With the Old, In With the New: The Continual Process of Upgrading HTTPS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s always important in cryptography to upgrade best practices as new attacks are discovered. Ideally of course, by the time algorithms are broken they&#039;ve already been phased out of use. The web has often been very slow in removing support for outdated algorithms. 2015 was encouraging in that several important changes were made to upgrade the security of crypto on the web:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although it happened several years after the other major browsers, Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3058515&quot;&gt;finally added support&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security&quot;&gt;HSTS&lt;/a&gt;, an important standard to allow Internet domains (such as eff.org) to ban downgrades to insecure plain HTTP. All major current browsers now support HSTS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome and Firefox both rolled out support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning&quot;&gt;public-key pinning&lt;/a&gt; (HPKP), enabling domains to specify an allowable whitelist of keys or certificate authorities to block rogue certificates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The long funeral procession for the RC4 cipher has finally reached the cemetery. We&#039;ve known RC4 was vulnerable for over a decade and there have been an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity13/technical-sessions/paper/alFardan&quot;&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Attacking_SSL_when_using_RC4.pdf&quot;&gt;practical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rc4nomore.com/&quot;&gt;attacks&lt;/a&gt; over the past few years, prompting IETF to officially &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7465&quot;&gt;declare RC4 banned for continued use&lt;/a&gt;. In September, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/09/01/ending-support-for-the-rc4-cipher-in-microsoft-edge-and-internet-explorer-11/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21msg/mozilla.dev.platform/JIEFcrGhqSM/CIjtpwxoLQAJ&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#%21msg/security-dev/kVfCywocUO8/vgi_rQuhKgAJ&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously announced RC4 will be completely disabled by early next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The long-running phaseout of the hash function &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2014/09/23/phasing-out-certificates-with-sha-1-based-signature-algorithms/&quot;&gt;SHA-1 continues&lt;/a&gt;. As of January 1, 2016, new certificates issued using SHA-1 will no longer be trusted. While a full collision in SHA-1 is yet to be found which would represent a serious break of the algorithm in practice, about the next-closest attack was announced in October of this year (a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/967.pdf&quot;&gt;free-start collision&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Shape of Crypto To Come &amp;amp; NSA&#039;s Troubled Leadership Role&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might look back on 2015 as the last year that non-quantum-safe cryptography was considered acceptable. This comes from an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/index.shtml&quot;&gt;official NSA announcement&lt;/a&gt; this August—not the leaked documents we&#039;ve grown used to. The announcement states that NSA will update its list of recommend cryptographic algorithms to include only algorithms which are resistant to cryptanalysis by quantum computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, most cryptographers believe moving to quantum-safe algorithms is necessary. Quantum computers may never exist, but cryptography is about defending against the strongest conceivable adversary. So on the surface, early government support for this inevitable upgrade should be a positive development that cryptographers can rally behind. Unfortunately, this NSA announcement was also met with considerable skepticism and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a steady erosion of trust in the NSA&#039;s information assurance mission due to incidents like its tampering with the Dual_EC standard. As a result, many in the cryptography community aren&#039;t sure what the real NSA motives are (and the announcement didn&#039;t offer any explanation). Is NSA simply being cautious? Have they actually developed a working quantum computer (which would be the world&#039;s first)? Are they trying to replace secure algorithms with &quot;quantum-safe&quot; algorithms that are actually back-doored? Or are there other motives involved? Neal Koblitz and Alfred Menezes, two experienced and well-respected cryptographers, outlined &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018.pdf&quot;&gt;many possible interpretations of this announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this is major news because US government agencies will be obligated to upgrade to whichever algorithms the NSA decides are quantum-safe and hence the entire computer industry will have to support them. Today, the Suite B list of recommend algorithms (AES, SHA-256, ECDSA and so on) are still a de facto standard and are by and large considered secure. But in the long run, the announcement should have us asking the question: who should be in charge of setting cryptography standards? Can the US government still lead this process in an open and transparent way which the community believes is about ensuring security rather than planting another round of dangerous backdoors that the next generation of cryptographers will have to deal with?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Who&#039;s Driving This Thing? Anti-DRM Victories and Milestones: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/whos-driving-thing-anti-drm-victories-and-milestones-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sometimes news events make your point better than you ever could. That was the case this year as we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/2015-dmca-rulemaking&quot;&gt;completed the triennial rulemaking cycle&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca-rulemaking&quot;&gt;requesting exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act&#039;s (DMCA)&#039;s&lt;/a&gt; restrictions on circumventing DRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of requesting an exemption is unnecessarily long and difficult, in a number of ways: the Copyright Office demands extensive evidence from those seeking exemptions, exemptions don&#039;t “roll over” to the next cycle – even if they&#039;re unopposed, and the resulting rules are too limited in scope. Still, EFF participates and has been able to secure some important victories—laying the groundwork for fair uses like jailbreaking phones or ripping DVDs for non-commercial remixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But given the length of the process—we submitted our first filing in this year&#039;s proceeding over a year ago, and began researching well before that—it&#039;s not always obvious which issues will capture the public imagination. To be clear, all of the exemptions we seek are important, and any limitation on a consumer&#039;s fair use rights is bad, but some can seem even more relevant and urgent as they get the spotlight of the news cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/eff-librarian-congress-let-car-owners-look-under-hood&quot;&gt;our exemption requests for security research and repair on cars&lt;/a&gt; made the leap from forward-looking to immediate and real, thanks to a handful of news stories that rocked the automobile industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, 2015 was the summer of high-profile car hacking. Security researchers found a vulnerability that allowed them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/&quot;&gt;remotely control a Jeep&lt;/a&gt; in some circumstances, and tested it out—with a journalist in tow. Another pair of researchers found a way to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/08/researchers-hacked-model-s-teslas-already/&quot;&gt;take over Tesla software&lt;/a&gt;, and presented their research at Def Con. This time last year, we knew that cars were vulnerable to nearby hackers via wireless, but the vulnerability of Internet-connected vehicles makes the problem exponentially more significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would have been enough, but the news cycle seemed determined to validate our requests in another way. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had opposed&lt;a href=&quot;http://copyright.gov/1201/2015/USCO-letters/EPA_Letter_to_USCO_re_1201.pdf&quot;&gt; our exemptions&lt;/a&gt;, saying that users might modify their cars to change the emissions output, bypassing the manufacturer&#039;s carefully calibrated settings. That EPA filing argued, in essence, for enforcing centralized manufacturer control instead of the transparency and autonomy afforded by more permissive research and tinkering rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a perfectly good answer to this concern: we can handle emissions problems with environmental laws. It makes no sense, and causes real problems, to use a layer of para-copyright to address it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An even better answer came from September&#039;s biggest business news. Volkswagen was caught &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34324772&quot;&gt;programming its cars to “cheat” on emissions tests&lt;/a&gt;, performing better than they would in real-world settings. Researchers were able to determine that something suspicious was going on, but were unable to discover the cheat software itself. In trying to access that software, they would have been hindered by the backdrop of legal uncertainty created by the DMCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of all these stories, it was rewarding to see our exemptions granted—even if we were frustrated to see a one-year lag and other counterproductive limitations imposed on them. The Copyright Office and the Librarian of Congress &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/victory-users-librarian-congress-renews-and-expands-protections-fair-uses&quot;&gt;granted our other exemptions as well&lt;/a&gt; (also with some limitations). All in all, we were happy to pull down another set of victories for users, even if we object to the process that generates them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems created by the DMCA&#039;s DRM provisions are coming into sharper focus with each passing day. Through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/cory-doctorow-rejoins-eff-eradicate-drm-everywhere&quot;&gt;ambitious projects like Apollo 1201&lt;/a&gt;, EFF and others are working to fix the problems at the root of DRM policies. In this space next year, we hope to be reporting even bigger victories.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Free Speech in the Middle East and North Africa: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/free-speech-middle-east-and-north-africa-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;For an increasing number of Internet users in parts of the Middle East, posting to social media is a liability, a risk not worth taking. Since the 2011 uprisings, the region has seen an increase in &lt;a href=&quot;http://smex.silk.co/&quot;&gt;laws governing online speech&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an increase in arrests related to political speech. 2015 has been a particularly bad year for those wishing to speak freely about their governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The past few months have seen an Egyptian pharmacist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecairopost.com/news/165173/inside_egypt/pharmacist-detained-for-criticizing-sovaldi&quot;&gt;detained for criticizing a pharmaceutical&lt;/a&gt;, a Kuwaiti &lt;a href=&quot;http://anhri.net/?p=150827&quot;&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; for tweeting about the country’s rulers, a Jordanian &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffpostarabi.com/2015/12/07/story_n_8739400.html?utm_hp_ref=arabi&quot;&gt;sentenced to two years in jail&lt;/a&gt; for criticizing his country’s ties to Israel, a Moroccan news editor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.altpresse.com/%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AA/12200-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%26quot%3B%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%83%26quot%3B.html&quot;&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; for posting about an already-widespread government leak on Facebook, a Palestinian university student &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.igmena.org/index.php?p=488&quot;&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; after criticizing government officials on Facebook, a Lebanese journalist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lbcamerica.com/news/233706/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D9%86%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%81%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1-%D9%88%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9/ar&quot;&gt;imprisoned&lt;/a&gt; for a “libelous” Facebook post, a Bahraini &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/updates/2015/08/arrest-of-inter-faith-activist-and-columbia-global-freedom-of-expression-expert-maytham-al-salman/&quot;&gt;seized&lt;/a&gt; for tweeting against sectarianism...and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/18/appendix-c-detailed-tables/#free-speech&quot;&gt;Pew poll&lt;/a&gt;, which included Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine, found that publics around the world showed widespread support for the right to criticize government. A majority in each country—98% of Lebanese, 63% of Jordanians, and 74% of Palestinians offered support for such a right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Despite such widespread support, political censorship remains high, and outspoken users remain at-risk. Such government restrictions, coupled with the widespread perception of surveillance, most certainly leads to self-censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;At a time when Western governments and companies are seeking to take down more content on social media, the risk to outspoken political activists grows. While the West is focused on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/4144762/social-media-terrorism/&quot;&gt;removal of speech that supports terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the Islamic State, the methods being undertaken risk the censorship of other content, including speech against IS. And at a time when criticism of Arab governments’ actions in response to both terrorism and the refugee crisis is high, it is imperative that the right to free expression is protected in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;To that end, EFF works with groups throughout the region to produce &lt;a href=&quot;https://digcit.org&quot;&gt;Digital Citizen&lt;/a&gt; and advocate on issues of concern. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/offline&quot;&gt;Offline&lt;/a&gt; project features several cases from the Middle East and North Africa. And we will continue to lend coverage to the free expression and privacy issues that our colleagues in the region face.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Our Fight to Rein In the CFAA: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/our-fight-rein-cfaa-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One of the most frustrating things about law is how slowly it changes, leaving courts to apply old laws to facts that Congress never anticipated. That’s certainly the case with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/cfaa&quot;&gt;Computer Fraud and Abuse Act&lt;/a&gt; (CFAA)—the federal “anti-hacking” statute, which was passed back in 1986 and is notoriously out of touch with how we use computers today. This year has seen some minor victories for the CFAA, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFAA makes it illegal to intentionally access a &quot;protected computer&quot;—which includes any computer connected to the Internet—without authorization or in excess of authorization. But it doesn’t tell us what &quot;without authorization&quot; means. This has given overzealous prosecutors broad discretion to bring criminal charges under an anti-hacking statute for behavior that in no way qualifies as “hacking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/eff-submits-sentencing-support-letter-jeremy-hammond&quot;&gt;every&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/password-sharing-is-not-a-crime&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/01/remembering-aaron&quot;&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;, this year has seen prosecutors pursuing trumped up and politically motivated CFAA charges. The most well known of this year’s convictions is probably the case of journalist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/03/3-months-or-35-years-understanding-cfaa-sentencing-part-1-why-maximums-matter&quot;&gt;Matthew Keys&lt;/a&gt;, who was charged and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/10/matthew-keys-journalist-conviction-cfaa-abuses/&quot;&gt;convicted&lt;/a&gt; of three felony counts under the CFAA as a result of what would amount to low-level vandalism in the physical world. Keys, who will be sentenced in January, faces up to 25 years in federal prison—even while a prosecutor on the case publically &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/11/matthew-keys-case-feds-know-who-the-real-hacker-sharpie-is/&quot;&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that “[t]his is not the crime of the century.” It’s also likely not what Congress had in mind when it passed the CFAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been pushing for CFAA reform for years as a result of such abuse of prosecutorial discretion. And this year Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/aarons-law-reintroduced-cfaa-didnt-fix-itself&quot;&gt;reintroduced legislation&lt;/a&gt;—dubbed “Aaron’s Law” in honor of Internet hero &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/08/aaron-swarts-work-internets-own-boy&quot;&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt;—aimed at reining in some of that discretion. The law would have limited both the CFAA’s steep penalties and prosecutors’ ability to bring duplicate charges for what amounts to the same conduct, and it would have ensured that people could not face criminal liability for violating terms of service or other contractual agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That legislation didn’t make it through Congress this year, but we did manage to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/some-good-news-about-cisa-it-doesnt-include-dangerous-computer-fraud-and-abuse&quot;&gt;fend off a dangerous &quot;reform&quot;&lt;/a&gt; that would have taken things in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/senator-sheldon-whitehouse-wants-make-computer-fraud-and-abuse-act-even-easier&quot;&gt;opposite direction&lt;/a&gt;—reform which Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse tried to slip through Congress via an amendment to the already-terrible &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/eff-disappointed-cisa-passes-senate&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015&lt;/a&gt; (CISA). The amendment would have only increased—not alleviated—the CFAA’s harshness, overbreadth, and confusion. And it would have potentially chilled important security research by expanding the statute’s password trafficking prohibition to include any “means of access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the amendment was not ultimately included in the bill—a fact Sen. Whitehouse blames on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4556085/masters-universe-versus-sheldon-whitehouse&quot;&gt;&quot;pro-botnet&quot; caucus&lt;/a&gt;. We like to think it had something to do with the many emails from our supporters opposing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also been fighting the CFAA in court. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/violating-employers-computer-use-restriction-not-federal-crime&quot;&gt;convinced&lt;/a&gt; the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to join the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/04/until-today-if-you-were-17-it-could-have-been-illegal-read-seventeencom-under-cfaa&quot;&gt;Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal&lt;/a&gt; in ruling that violations of private use restrictions cannot give rise to CFAA liability, widening the circuit split on the issue. The court took to heart our warning that the government’s expansive interpretation of the law would turn millions of innocent individuals into criminals on the basis of innocuous online behavior, like violating an employer’s computer use policy. The court recognized that prosecutors should not enjoy such broad discretion, stating that “[w]hile the Government might promise that it would not prosecute an individual for checking Facebook at work, we are not at liberty to take prosecutors at their word in such matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/wednesday-hearing-facebook-lawsuit-against-power-ventures&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; before the Ninth Circuit in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/03/facebooks-ongoing-legal-saga-power-ventures-dangerous-innovators-and-consumers&quot;&gt;Facebook v. Power Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, urging the court to overrule a district court’s determination that merely designing a computer program to have the capacity to bypass an IP address block is a violation of the CFAA. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.gwu.edu/Faculty/profile.aspx?id=3568&quot;&gt;Law Professor Orin Kerr&lt;/a&gt; argues in a forthcoming law review &lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2601707&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, bypassing an IP address block is routine online behavior and should not give rise to CFAA liability. The case was brought by Facebook back in 2008 under the CFAA’s provision allowing private computer owners to bring civil CFAA causes of action, and it’s a prime example of how judicial interpretations of the law in civil cases can have disastrous effects on the scope of criminal law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we are still waiting for a decision from the Ninth Circuit in another CFAA case argued this year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/u-s-v-nosal&quot;&gt;U.S. v. Nosal&lt;/a&gt; (up in the Court of Appeals for the second time), which addresses whether password sharing is a crime. We filed an amicus brief in the case late last year arguing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/password-sharing-is-not-a-crime&quot;&gt;it’s not&lt;/a&gt;. We expect a decision from the court sometime next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Second Circuit joining the Fourth and Ninth Circuits in limiting the scope of the CFAA, we’ve certainly seen some progress this year. But CFAA reform is still desperately needed. And it’s scary to think that some representatives in Congress actually think this draconian law needs to be expanded, rather than curtailed. Next year, we will continue our fight to rein in the CFAA—both in Congress and in the courts—and we hope to see even more progress despite the efforts there will surely be to undue what we’ve already accomplished. P&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/reform-computer-crime-law&quot;&gt;lease add your voice to the fight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Ban on CD Ripping Marks This Year&#039;s Lowest Point in International Copyright: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/international-copyright-law-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2015 has been quite an interesting year for copyright law around the world—at least in the sense of that apocryphal Chinese curse, “may you live in interesting times.” That is to say that most of this year&#039;s copyright developments have been bad for users, but with one notable exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To open on a broadly positive note, let&#039;s review that exception: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/european-parliament-blazes-path-overdue-copyright-reform&quot;&gt;groundbreaking July resolution on copyright reform&lt;/a&gt; by the European Parliament, led by the long-suffering Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Pirate Party, Julia Reda. That resolution, although weaker than we would have liked, nevertheless sent several clear messages to the European Commission. Amongst these messages were that payment or permission should not be required before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/12/google-news-shuts-shop-spain-thanks-ancillary-copyright-law&quot;&gt;linking to websites&lt;/a&gt; or taking photographs of public buildings (&quot;freedom of panorama&quot;). On December 9, the Commission released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?action=display&amp;amp;doc_id=12526&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Copyright Communication&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) drawing on the Parliament&#039;s report, that foreshadowed the introduction of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://copyright4creativity.eu/2015/12/09/copyright-reform-c4c-applauds-regrets-and-opposes/&quot;&gt;few modest changes&lt;/a&gt; to European copyright law, including a few new European-wide copyright exceptions such as freedom of panorama, and text and data mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this modest positive movement, we have to count the cost of a number of unfortunate losses elsewhere. Topping the list of these surely has to be the intolerable decision of the United Kingdom High Court in June to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/european-copyright-madness-court-strikes-down-law-allowing-users-rip-their-own-cds&quot;&gt;strike down the legalization of CD ripping&lt;/a&gt;, to which British lawmakers had only just agreed only after years of reviews and lobbying. As a result, if anyone in the United Kingdom is still buying physical CDs nowadays, they are breaking the law if they wish to transfer the contents onto their phone or computer. Could you imagine a decision more out of step with the digital age?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost as bad were the unwarranted copyright term extensions that took place during 2015. These include Jamaica&#039;s surprise extension of copyright by 45 years to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/anatomy-copyright-coup-jamaicas-public-domain-plundered&quot;&gt;life plus 95 years&lt;/a&gt;, and Canada handing over an additional 20 years to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/dice-loaded-against-public-canadas-copyright-term-extension&quot;&gt;music publishers and performers&lt;/a&gt;. Worse may be to come in 2016, if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp&quot;&gt;Trans-Pacific Partnership&lt;/a&gt; (TPP) comes into force. This will force six countries across the Pacific Rim to extend their term of copyright to life plus 70 years; a term that economists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/tpps-copyright-trap&quot;&gt;unanimously agree is unreasonably long&lt;/a&gt; to achieve its stated purpose of providing an incentive to creators. But none of these hold a candle to South Africa&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/south-african-copyright-review-overdue-pioneering-and-parts-completely-absurd&quot;&gt;proposal to create an unlimited term of copyright&lt;/a&gt; as a component of its proposed new orphan works regime—a proposal we hope will be dropped in the final law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also a number of adverse moves to harshen copyright enforcement measures around the world. South Africa was a late entrant in this category, with an ill-advised bill that would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/south-african-cybercrime-bill-would-throw-book-copyright-infringers&quot;&gt;criminalize almost any online copyright infringement&lt;/a&gt;. But sweeping the field for this year&#039;s worst new enforcement measures is Australia. In short order it brought in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/nobodys-surprise-australian-terrorism-law-may-be-used-copyright-enforcement&quot;&gt;data retention law&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/users-betrayed-australia-adopts-copyright-censorship-regime&quot;&gt;law to block copyright-infringing websites&lt;/a&gt; (which has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-19/small-australian-isp-refuses-to-bow-to-legal-threats-to-block-w/6955432&quot;&gt;already begun to be misused&lt;/a&gt;), as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/australias-proposed-copyright-alert-system-allows-rightsholders-spy-users&quot;&gt;three-strikes warning system&lt;/a&gt; for alleged infringing downloaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can only hope that copyright law changes in 2016 will be more positive for users, or at the very least, a bit less interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dragnet NSA Spying Survives: 2015 in Review</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/dragnet-nsa-spying-survives-2015-review</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/2015-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/12/16/2015-blog-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Secret mass surveillance continued to spark global controversy this year, yet the National Security Agency’s dragnet programs unconstitutionally monitoring Americans are stretching into their second decade. Ignited by news reports in 2005, eight years before Edward Snowden’s revelations blew the lid off &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files&quot;&gt;illegal and unconstitutional domestic spying&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, mounting concerns around the world about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/pen-america-harm-caused-surveillanceis-unmistakable&quot;&gt;the threat to free expression&lt;/a&gt; made 2015 a watershed year in the battle to restore privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal courts issued a series of competing decisions this year. Some acknowledged severe, ongoing abuses of millions of Americans and our fundamental rights. Others effectively turned a blind eye to government misconduct, agreeing with government arguments that the serious constitutional questions about these programs simply cannot be considered by the judiciary, even if they impact millions of innocent Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Congress finally took action to address some intelligence abuses, passing the USA FREEDOM Act this spring. While reforms in the USA FREEDOM Act remained less than needed to restore the rights and democratic principles undermined by mass surveillance, this summer was only the second time in US history that Congress cut back the powers of the intelligence agencies. Repudiating longstanding congressional deference to secrect mass surveillance, the USA FREEDOM Act reflects a growing transpartisan recognition of the need for oversight, transparency, and privacy-protecting reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the courts and Congress, popular concerns surrounding mass surveillance continue to resound around the world, and all across America. With so little having been done to assuage those concerns, rest assured that EFF—along with the global civil society harmed by mass surveillance—will be back in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dueling court decisions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, a District Court in Maryland &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/93._d._md._opinion_10.23.2015.pdf&quot;&gt;ruled to dismiss&lt;/a&gt; a complaint challenging mass surveillance filed by the Wikimedia Foundation. Jenna McLaughlin wrote for &lt;i&gt;The Intercept&lt;/i&gt; that “courts allowed the federal government to &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2015/10/27/two-aclu-defeats-highlight-judiciarys-lopsided-deference-to-executive-branch-secrecy/&quot;&gt;escape judicial oversight&lt;/a&gt; simply by insisting that national security matters should remain secret.” My colleague Mark Rumold &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/wikimedia-v-nsa-another-court-blinds-itself-mass-nsa-surveillance&quot;&gt;put it another way&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This game is mighty familiar to us at EFF, but that doesn’t make it any less troubling. In our system, the courts have a fundamental obligation to conclusively determine the legality of government action that affects individuals’ constitutional rights. For years now, plaintiffs have tried to get the courts to simply issue a ruling on the merits of NSA surveillance programs. And for years, the government has successfully persuaded the courts to rely on standing and related doctrines to avoid doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Jewel v NSA, First Unitarian Church v NSA, and Smith v Obama in the Ninth Circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week after the &lt;i&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/i&gt; ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard oral argument in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jewel v. NSA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a case EFF filed in 2008. The government has repeatedly delayed consideration of the case toavoid addressing the merits of our complaint. This year, government lawyers argued to the court that it couldn’t &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; decide &lt;i&gt;whether it could decide&lt;/i&gt; whether the government tapping into AT&amp;amp;T’s fiberoptic cables violated the Fourth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously. The truth is stranger than any fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, on December 18, the Ninth Circuit agreed with the government. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/9th-circuit-opinion-motion-dismiss-appeal&quot;&gt;appellate panel ruled&lt;/a&gt; that it will not rule on the Fourth Amendment issues arising from tapping into Internet cables even though the government admitted doing so, but will instead wait for the lower court to complete its examination of the entire case before considering an appellate review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2015/08/04/backbone-2015-08b-color.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;837&quot; width=&quot;642&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years after we filed &lt;i&gt;Jewel&lt;/i&gt;, and responding to further revelations in 2013 by whistleblower Edward Snowden, we filed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/first-unitarian-church-los-angeles-v-nsa&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;First Unitarian Church v NSA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of nearly two dozen organizations from across the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;First Unitarian&lt;/i&gt; expanded on &lt;i&gt;Jewel&lt;/i&gt; not only by citing new evidence, but also by focusing attention on the First Amendment right of association. The Supreme Court has long recognized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/first-unitarian-church-los-angeles-v-nsa#why-associations&quot;&gt;a right to anonymous membership&lt;/a&gt; in, and association with, organizations. That right is simply incompatible with a mass surveillance regime that tracks every telephone call made to or from those organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the court has also delayed considering &lt;i&gt;First Unitarian&lt;/i&gt;. Representing millions of Americans among their combined memberships, our clients have awaited a hearing date for over two years since we finished preliminary briefing before the District Court in early 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, presiding over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/smith-v-obama&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Smith v Obama&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill reached &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-idd-2_13-cv-00257/pdf/USCOURTS-idd-2_13-cv-00257-0.pdf&quot;&gt;a decision&lt;/a&gt; in June 2014, dismissing a challenge by a neonatal nurse from Idaho. EFF joined as counsel in the appeal of that case, along with the ACLU.  We continue to await an appellate ruling from the Ninth Circuit, having briefed the court on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/how-usa-freedom-impacts-ongoing-nsa-litigation&quot;&gt;how recent legislation relates&lt;/a&gt; to our claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Klayman v Obama in the DC Circuit and Wikimedia v NSA in the District of Maryland&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, 2015 saw two other cases in which courts fell for a procedural &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/appeals-court-falls-for-governments-shell-game-nsa-spying-case&quot;&gt;shell game&lt;/a&gt; the government has been pushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2013, responding to a complaint by conservative lawyer Larry Klayman, District Judge Richard Leon wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/historic-ruling-federal-judge-declares-nsa-mass-phone-surveillance-likely&quot;&gt;a thoughtful opinion&lt;/a&gt; acknowledging how mass surveillance offends constitutional rights. Judge Leon examined the allegations of whistleblowers, and the government’s admissions. He went on to explain how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/smith-v-maryland-turns-35-its-healths-declining&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Smith v Maryland&lt;/i&gt;, a prior 1979 case allowing limited surveillance&lt;/a&gt; under specific circumstances, could not justify a contemporary dragnet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in &lt;i&gt;Smith&lt;/i&gt;, the types of information at issue in this case are relatively limited: phone numbers dialed, date, time, and the like. But the ubiquity of phones has dramatically altered the quantity of the information that is now available, and more importantly, what that information can tell the Government about people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching beyond specific cases to consider the underlying constitutional principles and historical context, Judge Leon went on to write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot imagine a more ‘indiscriminate’ and ‘arbitrary invasion’ than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying it and analyzing it without judicial approval… the author of the Constitution, James Madison… would be aghast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government appealed Judge Leon’s decision to the D.C. Circuit, where EFF’s Cindy Cohn argued in 2014 alongside plaintiffs’ counsel. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/ED64DC482F286F1785257EAF004F71E8/$file/14-5004-1570210.pdf&quot;&gt;D.C. Circuit overruled&lt;/a&gt; Judge Leon this August in &lt;i&gt;Klayman v Obama&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The D.C. Circuit’s &lt;i&gt;Klayman &lt;/i&gt;ruling effectively held that the plaintiffs lacked the right to challenge the program in court. It reflected &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/appeals-court-falls-for-governments-shell-game-nsa-spying-case&quot;&gt;judicial confusion&lt;/a&gt; about the underlying facts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/supreme-court-dismisses-aclus-challenge-nsa-warrantless-wiretapping-law?redirect=national-security/supreme-court-dismisses-aclus-challenge-nsa-warrantless-wiretapping-law&quot;&gt;misapplying&lt;/a&gt; the Supreme Court’s regrettable 2013 ruling in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-1025_ihdj.pdf&quot;&gt;Clapper v Amnesty Int’l&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. In &lt;i&gt;Clapper&lt;/i&gt;, the Supreme Court dismissed a challenge brought by journalists and human rights advocates because they were unable to provide evidence that they, specifically, would in fact be secretly monitored by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowden gave that evidence to journalists, who publicly documented the NSA’s pervasive collection of telephone records. Moreover, the government strenuously defended the program, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/blog/2015/05/11/mitch-mcconnell-still-thinks-the-nsa-sho&quot;&gt;claiming a need before several congressional oversight committees&lt;/a&gt; to collect all (or nearly all) telephone records to get “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibtimes.com/nsa-surveillance-scandal-all-personal-records-are-relevant-slippery-legal-theory-stand-1363691&quot;&gt;the entire haystack&lt;/a&gt;.” Yet in &lt;i&gt;Klayman&lt;/i&gt; the D.C. Circuit continued to evade a decision on the merits by ruling that no individuals other than Verizon Business Services customers during a three month period could bring suit, even though customers of other services, during other times, were obviously subjected to NSA collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, two months after the D.C. Circuit’s disappointing decision in &lt;i&gt;Klayman&lt;/i&gt;, yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/wikimedia-v-nsa-another-court-blinds-itself-mass-nsa-surveillance&quot;&gt;another federal court&lt;/a&gt;—this time, a district court in Maryland—cited the same sort of standing concerns as the basis to dismiss a lawsuit challenging mass surveillance even before considering any evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, the District Court repeatedly cited the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in &lt;i&gt;Clapper v Amnesty&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/93._d._md._opinion_10.23.2015.pdf&quot;&gt;ruling to dismiss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wikimedia v. NSA&lt;/i&gt;. The court bent over backward to describe widespread “allegations” as “depend[ing] on suppositions and speculation, with no basis in fact,” despite the ample record provided by documents published around the world and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pclob.gov/library/215-Report_on_the_Telephone_Records_Program.pdf&quot;&gt;the government’s own admissions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;ACLU v Clapper in the Second Circuit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were, however, bright spots in the courts. The most potentially influential was a May 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/clapper-ca2-opinion.pdf&quot;&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in &lt;i&gt;ACLU v Clapper&lt;/i&gt;. The government did not challenge the ACLU’s standing, so the court did not consider that issue, nor did it resolve any constitutional claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a stinging rejection of the government’s statutory arguments, the Second Circuit sustained the challenge. It held that in Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act—which the government had interpreted in secret—Congress never authorized the mass telephone surveillance program revealed by Edward Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than accept executive secrecy as a reason to insulate a program from judicial review, the Second Circuit ruled that executive secrecy precluded any legislative intent supporting the program. Responding to government claims that Congress approved NSA mass surveillance when voting to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act in 2010 and 2011, the court explained that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress cannot reasonably be said to have ratified a program of which many members of Congress—and all members of the public—were not aware… Practically speaking, it is a far stretch to say that Congress was aware of the FISC’s legal interpretation of §215 when it reauthorized the statute in 2010 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announced in early May, just a few weeks before a congressional deadline to reauthorize section 215, the Second Circuit’s &lt;i&gt;Clapper&lt;/i&gt; ruling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/aclu-v-clapper-and-congress-how-second-circuits-decision-affects-legislative&quot;&gt;seemed at first&lt;/a&gt; to suggest broader reforms. The House of Representatives &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2015/05/landslide-vote-house-overwhelmingly-passes-usa-freedom-act-without-amendments&quot;&gt;passed a compromise bill&lt;/a&gt; to extend the telephone program with some limited reforms, but the Senate &lt;a href=&quot;http://progressive.org/news/2015/05/188151/senate-moves-check-executive-spying-power&quot;&gt;let the reauthorization deadline pass&lt;/a&gt; for a few short days before ultimately &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/02/politics/bulk-data-collection-coming-back-usa-freedom-act/index.html&quot;&gt;resuscitating mass telephone surveillance&lt;/a&gt; under a new statute: the USA FREEDOM Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Important but limited policy reform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this summer, the last time Congress had taken legislative action addressing NSA surveillance was in 2008, when it expanded the Agency’s powers through premature and deferential &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr6304/text&quot;&gt;amendments&lt;/a&gt; to the Foreign Intelligence Service Act (FISA) of 1978.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barack-obama/my-position-on-fisa_b_110789.html&quot;&gt;Controversially supported&lt;/a&gt; by then Senator Barack Obama, the 2008 FISA amendments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/case-against-retroactive-amnesty-telecoms&quot;&gt;blocked a series of cases&lt;/a&gt; proceeding through the courts (including &lt;i&gt;Hepting v. AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/hepting&quot;&gt;an EFF lawsuit filed in 2006&lt;/a&gt;) that threatened to expose corporate complicity in illegal government surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies. The 2008 FISA amendments also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2008/07/09&quot;&gt;unwound a series of crucial reforms&lt;/a&gt; imposed by Congress in the 1970s after the Church Committee’s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that context, 2015’s USA FREEDOM Act represented an overdue course correction. That’s in part why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/08/understanding-new-usa-freedom-act-questions-concerns-and-effs-decision-support&quot;&gt;EFF initially supported it&lt;/a&gt; in early versions, particularly the version &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/floor-not-ceiling-supporting-usa-freedom-act-step-towards-less-surveillance&quot;&gt;introduced in October 2013&lt;/a&gt;. After the important Second Circuit decision raised hopes for Congress to consider stronger reforms, EFF &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/aclu-v-clapper-and-congress-how-second-circuits-decision-affects-legislative&quot;&gt;withdrew our support&lt;/a&gt; for the USA FREEDOM Act, but did not oppose it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/usa-freedom-act/&quot;&gt;version ultimately adopted by Congress&lt;/a&gt; in June 2015 enabled new oversight, and placed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/new-usa-freedom-act-step-right-direction-more-must-be-done&quot;&gt;some real restrictions&lt;/a&gt; on NSA surveillance powers. For instance, it requires the government to limit its collection of call records to those chosen based on a “specific selection term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most significantly, the law increased transparency at the secret FISA court responsible for approving surveillance requests. It created a cadre of &lt;em&gt;amici curiae&lt;/em&gt; (friends of the court) to brief the judges when considering novel legal questions, and directed the executive branch to declassify “significant” FISA court opinions. Instead of hearing from only one side in secret, the FISA court will now hear opposing views at least sometimes, and will have to declassify at least some of its opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell how meaningful the new law will prove to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, however, the first appointed &lt;em&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/em&gt;—a former federal prosecutor—has written to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emptywheel.net/tag/preston-burton/&quot;&gt;counter government arguments&lt;/a&gt; before the FISA court. In November, he wrote to the court to inform its consideration of a key issue in EFF’s cases arising from the government’s obligation to preserve evidence supporting our challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/BR%2015-99%20REPLY%20MEMORANDUM%20OF%20AMICUS%20CURIAE%20TO%20THE%20UNITED%20STATES%20RESPONSE%20TO%20OCTOBER%2029%2C%202015%20MEMORANDUM%20OF%20LAW%20%28Redacted%29.pdf&quot;&gt;unwillingness to address its various litigation positions&lt;/a&gt;, some of which appear to have contributed to the prolonged hold [preventing the destruction of evidence], speaks volumes. For example, its resort to incanting the state secrets privilege seems rather energetic given the robust public discussion of this program…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USA FREEDOM Act’s transparency provisions and process improvements make its passage an important moment and a starting point for future reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/new-usa-freedom-act-step-right-direction-more-must-be-done&quot;&gt;much remains&lt;/a&gt; to be done. The USA FREEDOM Act &lt;a href=&quot;https://boingboing.net/2015/06/03/usa-freedom-act-the-good-the.html&quot;&gt;repudiated an era&lt;/a&gt; of congressional permissiveness and imposed important reforms to marginally increase transparency. Congress took aim at curbing surveillance abuses for the first time in 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political tide, however, began to turn back before the year was out. Within months, Congress moved to authorize new surveillance powers in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/eff-disappointed-cisa-passes-senate&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act&lt;/a&gt;, whose substantive provisions were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/statement-finalized-congressional-cybersecurity-bill&quot;&gt;included in an omnibus&lt;/a&gt; spending package &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/washington-markup/how-your-information-could-soon-end-hands-nsa-and-what-you-can-do-about-it&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; in late December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We’re Planning for 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Strong, uncompromised encryption makes us safe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2015, responses to horrific terror attacks in Paris took the form of what the New York Times described as “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/opinion/mass-surveillance-isnt-the-answer-to-fighting-terrorism.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;a wretched yet predictable ritual&lt;/a&gt; after each new terrorist attack: Certain politicians and government officials wast[ing] no time exploiting the tragedy for their own ends.” The Times went on to condemn premature and erroneous claims by CIA Director John Brennan (whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/senate-intelligence-commitee-cia-interrogation-report.html&quot;&gt;record hardly suggests trustworthiness&lt;/a&gt;) and made clear that privacy-protecting encryption played no role in the Paris attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve always said, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/opinion/mass-surveillance-isnt-the-answer-to-fighting-terrorism.html&quot;&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt; made clear&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I]ndiscriminate bulk data sweeps have not been useful. In the more than two years since the N.S.A.’s data collection programs became known to the public, the intelligence community has failed to show that the phone program has thwarted a terrorist attack. Yet for years intelligence officials and members of Congress repeatedly misled the public by claiming that it was effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting against canards and red herrings from the intelligence establishment is nothing new to EFF. We’ve been doing this for over 20 years. We hope in 2016, however, to help journalists, policymakers, and judges understand why access to strong, uncompromised encryption enhances security instead of undermining it. The idea that privacy and security are opposing values should be long dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Stopping dragnet Internet surveillance under FISA Section 702&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016 we also will move to keep the pressure on government Internet surveillance under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/way-nsa-uses-section-702-deeply-troubling-heres-why&quot;&gt;Section 702 of FISA&lt;/a&gt;. While the 2015 congressional policy debate centered on telephone surveillance under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, Internet surveillance is no less troubling and equally (if not even more) susceptible to politicization and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 702 is currently set to expire at the end of 2017, making the next two years a crucial period for establishing some long overdue transparency into how the government both interprets the law, and uses the technologies implementing it. Greater transparency—for instance, through &lt;a href=&quot;http://chsdemocrats.house.gov/sitedocuments/correctact2014finalfactsheet.pdf&quot;&gt;proposed reforms&lt;/a&gt; to restore order and common sense to the broken and bloated classification system—can help set the terms of debate in Congress and in the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those terms have shifted dramatically over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2014, the House of Representatives &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/eff-statement-massie-lofgren-amendment-passing-house&quot;&gt;voted by a more than 2-1 margin&lt;/a&gt; in favor of an amendment to the 2015 Department of Defense appropriations bill that nearly cut funding for NSA backdoor searches. The same year, the leaders of both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/nsa-reform-bill-intelligence-community-written-intelligence-community-and&quot;&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/54-civil-liberties-and-public-interest-organizations-oppose-fisa-improvements-act&quot;&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; Intelligence Committees—which Congress created in the 1970s to oversee the intelligence agencies after catching their hands in the constitutional cookie jar—announced bipartisan proposals to entrench domestic NSA spying powers. Yet Congress fended them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2015, only 18 months later, some &lt;a href=&quot;http://crooksandliars.com/2015/12/marco-rubio-attacks-ted-cruz-national&quot;&gt;presidential candidates are criticizing others’&lt;/a&gt; support for even the meager intelligence reforms of the FREEDOM ACT. Some of those same figures, using their seats in the Senate, have proposed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/marco-rubio-delay-surveillance-reform-usa-freedom-act&quot;&gt;legislation to delay implementation&lt;/a&gt; of the Act’s limited reforms to Section 215. Others championed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/eff-disappointed-cisa-passes-senate&quot;&gt;new surveillance powers&lt;/a&gt; masquerading as cybersecurity tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 702, meanwhile, hasn’t even been the subject of a meaningful congressional debate since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/eff-statement-massie-lofgren-amendment-passing-house&quot;&gt;narrowly surviving the congressional uprising&lt;/a&gt; in June 2014. It’s hardly the only surveillance power that Congress seems to have forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dragging Executive Order 12333 into the daylight&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2014, just a month after the intelligence agencies narrowly averted congressional reform targeting section 702, a former State Department employee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/meet-executive-order-12333-the-reagan-rule-that-lets-the-nsa-spy-on-americans/2014/07/18/93d2ac22-0b93-11e4-b8e5-d0de80767fc2_story.html&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that U.S. intelligence agencies also rely on Executive Order 12333 to collect data on, from, and about Americans. EFF was drawing attention to E.O. 12333 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/primer-executive-order-12333-mass-surveillance-starlet&quot;&gt;even earlier&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s rarely discussed in Washington today as the subject of privacy-expanding surveillance reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason may be that, whereas surveillance programs citing Section 215 or Section 702 as their legal justification face periodic congressional reauthorization deadlines, executive orders do not. But even though we can’t rely on a reauthorization deadline to force congressional attention, we will invite Congress to more closely examine surveillance under executive orders and consider limiting principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In the courts, in Congress, in the press, and in your community&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our legislative goals will continue to test the temerity of legislators, while our litigation projects will continue to test the constitutionality of the government’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new year, we’ll launch campaigns to reform both Section 702 and E.O. 12333 to protect Fourth Amendment principles violated by mass surveillance. We’ll also continue our struggle in the courts, pursuing our flagship cases in &lt;em&gt;Jewel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;First Unitarian&lt;/em&gt; while supporting aligned litigation like &lt;em&gt;Klayman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ACLU&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how many campaigns we wage, however, we know that ending mass surveillance—whether through an act of Congress, or a judicial ruling—will take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://supporters.eff.org/get-effs-resources-community-and-campus-organizers&quot;&gt;outspoken support in 2016 of concerned Americans&lt;/a&gt; from all walks of life.&lt;/p&gt;

Our mobilization against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/we-need-stop-white-house-putting-tpp-and-ttip-fast-track-ratification&quot;&gt;Fast Track trade bill&lt;/a&gt; resulted in some major twists and turns before the sudden conclusion of the negotiations in the Fall, then finally after more than five years of secrecy, the governments officially released the completed TPP text. This definitively confirmed that this trade agreement contained a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/release-full-tpp-text-after-five-years-secrecy-confirms-threats-users-rights&quot;&gt;whole host&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/final-leaked-tpp-text-all-we-feared&quot;&gt;restrictive digital policies&lt;/a&gt;—including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/transpacific-plague&quot;&gt;bans on circumventing DRM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/go-prison-sharing-files-thats-what-hollywood-wants-secret-tpp-deal&quot;&gt;heavy-handed criminal and civil penalties&lt;/a&gt; for copyright infringement, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/tpps-copyright-trap&quot;&gt;excessive copyright term lengths&lt;/a&gt;. This, of course, was hardly surprising given the secret, corporate-captured process that plagued this deal from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue on to the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/tpp-current-state-play-how-we-defeat-largest-trade-deal&quot;&gt;fight against the TPP&#039;s ratification into 2016&lt;/a&gt;, it&#039;s important to take stock of the critical battles that we&#039;ve won along the way. This year was particularly notable in how much we were able to delay the conclusion and signature of the deal. That can largely be credited to hundreds of public interest organizations and individuals that worked together to put the brakes on the passage of the Fast Track legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the debate on Fast Track (officially called the Trade Promotion Authority) came to a head this past Summer, we had already been organizing to oppose it for months. We knew that if we wanted to stop the TPP, killing the Fast Track bill was our best chance to prevent the undemocratic process from getting even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/its-time-act-now-congress-poised-introduce-bill-fast-track-tpp-next-week&quot;&gt;TPP&#039;s supporters in Congress began to roll out the Fast Track bill&lt;/a&gt;, they weren&#039;t expecting it to be as controversial as it was. We ended up sending hundreds of thousands of calls, emails, and petition signatures against the bill. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/leader-pelosi-come-out-against-tpp-fast-track&quot;&gt;We met with lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; and carried with us the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/hundreds-tech-companies-congress-tpp-and-fast-track-harms-digital-innovation-and&quot;&gt;letters of opposition from businesses and other interest groups&lt;/a&gt; against the TPP in order to make it crystal clear that a vote for Fast Track would essentially be a vote in support of a toxic deal for Internet freedom and user rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this made it really difficult for the White House to get the support it needed to pass the bill, putting &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/tpp-right-where-we-want-it-going-nowhere&quot;&gt;TPP itself at a standstill&lt;/a&gt;. Since the TPP wouldn&#039;t have been able to pass in the U.S. without Fast Track, the countries weren&#039;t willing to put their chips on the table until they knew how the trade bill would shake out in the United States. Additionally, TPP&#039;s delay meant the spotlight would be put on ratification of the deal during the U.S. presidential election, and would raise significant questions for its support under Canada&#039;s new government. This shifting political dynamic across the TPP countries was exactly what the U.S. Trade Representative wanted to avoid by passing Fast Track in early 2015. Of course, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/senate-passes-fast-track-we-can-still-prevent-tpp-train-wreck&quot;&gt;Fast Track ultimately did pass in Congress&lt;/a&gt; after some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/fast-track-ping-pongs-back-senate-administrations-desperation-mounts&quot;&gt;wild congressional maneuvers&lt;/a&gt;, but we had already done damage to the White House&#039;s precious timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By bringing the public&#039;s attention to the failures of transparency and oversight with the Fast Track process, we were also able to help bring about some minor procedural improvements. Most notably, it clearly stipulated some timelines for how and when the the text would be released: for example, it had to be released online in full, within 30 days of the President announcing his intent to sign the deal. Obviously, it would have been better if the bill hadn&#039;t passed at all, but these mandates are useful in constraining how the U.S. Trade Representative rolls forward with TPP&#039;s passage and that gives us an advantage in how we strategize our fight to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the elections looming in the U.S. and Canada, trade negotiators were now under pressure to conclude the deal. And they ultimately managed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/trade-officials-announce-conclusion-tpp-now-real-fight-begins&quot;&gt;finish it on October 5&lt;/a&gt;. A month later &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/release-full-tpp-text-after-five-years-secrecy-confirms-threats-users-rights&quot;&gt;when they released the final official text&lt;/a&gt;, we at long last able to dig into the details of the TPP and confirm that it carried &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/final-leaked-tpp-text-all-we-feared&quot;&gt;Hollywood&#039;s wish list of restrictive copyright rules&lt;/a&gt;, including a few other rotten bad digital policy provisions that we had never been able to see before. We&#039;ve analyzed the TPP to explain in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/how-tpp-will-affect-you-and-your-digital-rights&quot;&gt;concrete terms how it would impact all kinds of people&#039;s digital rights&lt;/a&gt;, from students, journalists, free software users, and even how it will affect our digital security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/tpp-current-state-play-how-we-defeat-largest-trade-deal&quot;&gt;We are still in the midst of this fight to stop the TPP.&lt;/a&gt; President Obama and the other leaders of TPP countries are likely to meet in February to sign the completed deal. That&#039;s why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/eff-joins-broad-coalition-groups-call-lawmakers-reject-tpp-washington-dc&quot;&gt;EFF joined dozens of other groups to protest the deal in the streets of Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; But what we&#039;ll really need to do is to take advantage of these shifting political landscapes and drive a wedge into the deal&#039;s ratification in all the TPP countries. Our strategy is to focus on stopping this deal in the U.S. because that will effectively also defeat it in the 11 other countries—that&#039;s also where we have our best shot to kill this thing for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re in the United States, urge your lawmakers to call a hearing on the contents of the TPP that will impact your digital rights, and more importantly, to vote this deal down when it comes to them for ratification:&lt;/p&gt;
